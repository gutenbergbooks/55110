better than the old camper, who has shaken
down his ideas, theories, practices, year after
year in the experiment of camping how true
this is. If one is wise, one goes well prepared
even into the simple life of the woods
or mountains or lakes; and it is in a practical
way, and under three so-called check
lists, (1) camp clothes, (2) camp food, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2">[2]</a></span>
(3) camp equipment, that I wish to tell you
something about camp life for girls.</p>

<p>From the point of view of clothes there
are two kinds of camping: one more or less
civilized, the other &#8220;rough.&#8221; In the first
perhaps we shall be allowed a small
box or trunk. In the second we have to
depend entirely upon a duffle bag or a knapsack.
To the camper who plans for a good
many comforts, there is only one warning
to be given: don&#8217;t be foolish and take finery
of any sort with you. Not only will it be
in the way, but also a girl does not look well
in the woods dressed in clothes that belong
to the home life of town or city.</p>

<p>There is an appropriate garb for the wilderness
even as there is the right gown for
an afternoon tea. Except for this warning,
what you will put in your trunk will be simply
an extension of the comforts which you
have in duffle bag or knapsack.</p>

<p>As the capacity of duffle bag or knapsack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page3">[3]</a></span>
is very limited, the check lists for its contents
must be made out with rigid economy.
The most important item is foot gear. A
well-made pair of medium weight boots,
carefully tanned, drenched with mutton tallow,
viscol, neat&#8217;s-foot oil, or some similar
waterproof substance, will prove the best for
all-round usefulness. These boots must be
broken in or worn before the camping expedition
is undertaken. Nothing is so foolish
as to start out in a new pair. Have in
addition to the boots a pair of soft indoor
moccasins. These are good to loaf around
camp in. They are grateful to tired feet,
and, rolled, take up but little space in the
knapsack. To the boots and moccasins add
from two to four pairs of hole-proof stockings
of some reliable make. If you can get
a really first-class stocking and are crowded
for space, two pairs will do. One goes on
to your feet and the other into your knapsack.
There should also be several combination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page4">[4]</a></span>
suits, preferably of two weights, high
necked, and with shoulder and knee caps.</p>

<p>Now, see that the skirt you wear is of
durable material; blue serge or tweed (corduroy
is often too heavy); that it has been
thoroughly shrunk, and is six inches off the
ground anyway. Twelve would be better.
Your skirt should be provided with ample
pockets; the sweater and jacket also. Under
the skirt wear a pair of bloomers, the
lighter and slimsier they are, the better; and
the stouter the material, the more practical
for wear. I have tried many kinds, and believe
percaline which is light, strong, slimsy
and washable, the best. Silk is not suitable
at all. A flannel shirt waist or blouse, a
windsor or string tie, a soft felt hat with a
sufficiently wide brim, but not too wide, complete
your costume.</p>

<p>Into the knapsack put two coarse handkerchiefs,
a silk neckerchief to tie around your
neck, the stockings and combination suit already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page5">[5]</a></span>
mentioned, a string of safety pins
clipped one into another, a toothbrush, tubes
of cold cream and tooth paste (tubes take
up the least room and are the easiest to
carry), a cotton shirtwaist, a nail file, comb,
small bottle of the best cascara sagrada tablets,
a pair of cotton gloves for rough work,
a cake of castile soap, a towel, a stiff nail
brush, <i>and, if you are wise</i>, a book for
leisure hours, preferably an anthology of
poems or a collection of essays which will
afford food for reflection.</p>

<p>In your preparations let it be the rule to
strip away every unnecessary article. Take
pride in getting your kit down to the absolute
minimum. Keep weeding out what you
don&#8217;t need, and then after that, weed out
again.</p>

<p>The same principle of rigid economy in
selection will obtain in the check list for
food. It is the minimum of expense in the
woods that will bring the maximum of comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page6">[6]</a></span>
In arranging for the &#8220;duffle&#8221; to be
taken with you there is one thing that can be
counted upon with mathematical certainty:
hunger. You are going to be hungrier than
you have been in a long time. The problem
is, then, how to tote enough food and <i>get</i>
enough food to supply your wants. The
carriage, the keeping, the nutritive value, all
these things have to be taken into consideration
in wood life. At home we have fresh
vegetables, fresh fruits, fresh meats in
abundance. How can we supply these things
for our camp table? We can&#8217;t! But desiccated
potatoes, dried apples, apricots,
prunes, peaches, white and yellow-eye beans,
dried lima beans, peas, whole or split, onions,
rice, raisins, nuts, white and graham flour,
corn meal, pilot biscuit, rolled oats, cream of
wheat, cocoa (leave coffee and tea at home),
sweet chocolate, syrup for flapjacks, baking
soda, sugar, salt, a few candles (helpful for
lighting a fire in wet weather, as well as good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page7">[7]</a></span>
for illumination), matches, molasses, a little
olive oil&mdash;all these things, with careful planning,
we may have in abundance. To these
items you should add good butter&mdash;the best
salted butter is none too good&mdash;some cans of
condensed milk and evaporated milk and
cream, and a flitch of bacon. Meat makes
a dirty camp, and a dirty camp means
skunks and hedgehogs prowling around. In
a properly thought-out dietary it will be entirely
unnecessary to tote meat. All that is
needed for use you can get at the end of
your fish rod or through the barrel of your
shotgun, and upon the freshness of what you
catch or shoot you can depend. Dr. Breck,
in his &#8220;Way of the Woods,&#8221; says that if he
were obliged to choose between bacon and
dried apples and chocolate, he would always
take the apples and chocolate. Both portage
and health will be served by avoiding the
carriage of a lot of tin cans. The ration of
each article needed you can work out with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page8">[8]</a></span>
your mother or housekeeper, according to
the number of people to be in the party,
the menus you plan, and the length of your
stay. For a cooler for your food, you will
find a wire bait box, sunk in clean running
water, excellent. The question of grub, or
duffle, as it is called in camp life, in proper
variety, abundance and freshness, is the most
difficult question of all. To this problem a
seasoned camper will give his closest attention.</p>

<p>There are other articles, plus the food
stuffs, which we must add to our check lists&mdash;chiefly
articles of equipment. Two or
three pails nesting into each other, a tin reflector
baker for outdoor cooking, enamel-ware
plates, cups and bowls, pans, dishpans,
dishmop, chain pot-cleaner, double boiler,
broiler, knives, forks, spoons, pepper and salt
shakers, flour sifter, rotary can opener, long-handled
and short-handled fry pans, a carving
knife and a fish knife. The cost of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page9">[9]</a></span>
things carefully bought, will be about six
dollars. There should also be in your kit
some nails and a hatchet, toilet paper,
woolen blankets, mosquito netting (tarlatan
is better), twine, tacks, oilcloth for camp
table, and some fly dope.</p>

<p>With these articles, plus a little knowledge
of woodcraft, there is almost no wilderness
into which a capable girl cannot go and make
an attractive home. But a little woodcraft
we must know; the rest we can learn as we
go. There is one fuel in the woods which
skillfully used will kindle any fire, even a
wet fire, and that is birch bark. You can
always get an inner layer of dry birch bark
from a tree. Keep a check list of different
kinds of wood and have it handy until you
learn these woods for yourself. Brush tops
or slashings will help to start a quick blaze.
Hickory is fine for a quiet hot fire. The
green woods which burn readily are white
and black birch, ash, oak and hard maple.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page10">[10]</a></span>
Look for pitch, which you are most likely
to find in old trees, and that will always help
out and start any fire. Woods that snap,
such as hemlock, spruce, cedar and larch, are
not to be recommended for camp fires, as a
rule. To be careless or stupid about the
camp fire may be to endanger the lives not
only of thousands of wild creatures in the
wilderness, but also the lives of human beings.</p>

<p>Be careful to have pure water to drink.
You cannot be too careful. If you are in
doubt about the water, don&#8217;t drink it, or at
least not until it has been thoroughly boiled.
Take with you, besides those I give, a few
useful recipes for cooking experiments. They
will bring pleasure and variety on dull days.
Choose a good place for your cabin or shack
or tent, whichever you use, especially a place
where the natural drainage is good. Know
before you set out whether black flies, mosquitoes
and midges have to be encountered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page11">[11]</a></span>
and go prepared to meet them. They are
sure to meet you more than halfway. Don&#8217;t
take any risks on land or water. The people
who know the way of the woods best are
those who are least foolhardy. Common
sense is the law that reigns in the wilderness,
and, in having our good time, we cannot
do better than to follow that law.</p>

<p>So much for skeleton check lists, many of
which, in the chapters to come, at the cost
of repetition, I shall amplify. Among the
questions which I shall take up are the all-important
ones of camp clothes, camp food,
cooking, the place, camp fires, furnishing the
camp, the pocketbook, the camp dog, the outdoor
training school, the camp habit, wood
culture, camp health, camp friendship, homemade
camping, the canoe, fishing, and the
trail. This great, big, beautiful country of
ours is full of girls, real <span class="smcap">Camp Fire Girls</span>,
who love the keen air of out of doors and
the smell of wood smoke and the freedom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page12">[12]</a></span>
hill and lake and plain, and to them I want
my little book to come home and to be a
camp manual which will go with them on all
journeys into the wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="fsize80">CAMP CLOTHES</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">I</span><span class="startword0">f</span> you have been camping once, there is
no need for any one to help you decide
what wearing apparel to take
the next time. Through the mistakes made
and the discomforts involved, the girl will
have learned her lesson too well to forget it.
But there is always the girl who has not been
camping. It is chiefly for her benefit that I
am writing these chapters on camp life for
girls.</p>

<p>In the first place, there are two kinds of
camp clothes to be considered, for there are
two kinds of camping: (1) the expedition
which permits taking a box or trunk with
you, and (2) the rougher camping that allows
only the carrying of a duffle bag or a
knapsack. If you are limited to a knapsack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page14">[14]</a></span>
or a duffle bag, your kit must be of the most
concentrated sort and chosen with the greatest
care. You will find ten or fifteen pounds
the most you wish to tote long distances, although
at the beginning this size of pack may
seem like nothing at all to you. As I have
found personally, even seven pounds, with
day after day of tramping, may make an unaccustomed
shoulder ache under the strap.</p>

<p>If you are to be limited to a small duffle
bag, or a fairly capacious knapsack, what
are the articles of clothing without which no
girl can start? Let us take up the most important
item first, and that is foot-gear.
Wear a well-made pair of medium weight
boots, thoroughly tanned, soaked with viscol,
or rubbed with mutton tallow both on
the inside and the outside, to make them
waterproof. <i>Never start out with a new
pair of boots on your feet.</i> If necessary, get
your boots weeks beforehand, and wear them
from time to time till they are thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page15">[15]</a><br /><a id="Page16">[16]</a></span>
comfortable. In addition to these boots
which you wear, take a soft pair of indoor
moccasins. These can be worn when you
are tired and loafing around camp, or while
the guide is drying or greasing your boots.
If you have ever worn moccasins and are
going to tramp in a moccasin country, that is,
a country of forest trails and ponds, then
buy a pair of heavy outdoor moccasins; larrigans
or ankle-moccasins are best. These
should not be too snug. Worn over a heavy
cotton stocking, or a light woolen one, or
woolen stockings drawn over cotton, the
moccasin is the most ideal foot-gear the wilderness
world can ever know.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Neat&#8217;s-foot
oil is also excellent for greasing moccasins.
Buy from two to four pairs of hole-proof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page17">[17]</a></span>
stockings of some reliable make. If these
stockings are first class and can be depended
upon, two pairs will do. One pair you will
wear, the other goes into your knapsack.
Have also several combination suits, some
for your bag and one for your back. These
suits should be high-necked and with shoulder
and knee caps; of sufficient warmth for
cold days and nights; in any case porous and
of two weights.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> If you have room take with you an extra pair of
shoes. When you have become a real woodswoman you
will never be without woolen socks and moccasins. The
thick, soft sole of sock and moccasin spare tender feet
which are not accustomed to hard tramping and rough
paths.</p></div>

<p>If you are going to tramp in a skirt, as
you must if your route touches upon civilization,
<i>see that it is short</i>. Six inches off the
ground is none too much, and twelve is a
good deal better. In an outing of this sort
it is as poor form to wear a long skirt as it
would be to wear a short skirt at an afternoon
tea in civilization. The skirt should
be of some good quality khaki, army preferably,
or a tweed; it should be thoroughly
shrunk, and if it seems desirable, it should
be possible to put this camp skirt in water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page18">[18]</a></span>
and wash it.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Have ample pockets on either
side of the front seams. If I had to choose
between the best of sweaters and a jacket
with a lot of pockets in it, I should always
choose the latter, and that is not on account
of the pockets alone, but because it is a more
convenient article of clothing. In case of
cold weather it affords better protection, also
better protection against rain as well as cold.
You can have it made with two outside
pockets and several inside&mdash;the more the
merrier. Underneath the skirt wear a pair
of bloomers. The lighter and stouter these
are, the more of a comfort they will be. I
have found a good quality of percaline to be
the best investment. Percaline is light,
strong, slimsy after a little wearing, and
washes well. I have never yet found a silk
that was practicable in the woods. Silk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page19">[19]</a></span>
bloomers go well with the comforts of civilization,
but they are not fit to endure the test
of roughing it. A flannel shirtwaist or
blouse, a Windsor or string tie, a soft felt
hat&mdash;you may have it as pretty as you wish,
provided it is not too large or over trimmed&mdash;complete
the outfit which you carry on you,
so to speak.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> You can buy an ideal hunting suit at any of the big
shops in Boston, New York or Chicago for from $8 to
$10.</p></div>

<p>Now to return to the outfit you carry in
your pack and not on your back. A pair of
indoor moccasins, an extra pair of hole-proof
stockings (these you must have, not
only on account of a possible wetting, but
also because the stockings must be changed
every day, for you cannot take too good
care of your feet), two coarse handkerchiefs
of ample size, a silk neckerchief to tie
around your neck, an extra combination suit,
a few safety pins clipped one into another
until you have made a string of them, a tooth
brush, a little tube of cold cream and a tube
of tooth paste (the tubes are not breakable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page20">[20]</a></span>
and take up the least room, they are therefore
the best to carry), a cotton or linen
shirtwaist of some kind, a nail file, a comb,
a small vial of cascara sagrada tablets, several
rolls of film for your camera&mdash;the
camera itself can be slung on a strap from
the knapsack&mdash;a pair of garden gloves for
rough work with sooty pots and kettles, a
good-sized cake of the best castile soap, a
towel, a good stiff nail brush, and one or two
books.</p>

<p>Personally I feel that the books are as indispensable
as anything in the knapsack, for
in moments of weariness, or when storm-bound,
they prove the greatest comfort and
resource. The volume taken must not be a
novel which read through once one does not
care to read again. Better to take some
book over which you can or must linger. I
have tramped scores of miles with the &#8220;Oxford
Book of English Verse&#8221; in my knapsack,
and it has proved the greatest imaginable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page21">[21]</a></span>
pleasure and solace. A small anthology
or a book of essays, or something
that you wish to study, as, for example,
guides about the birds or the trees or the
flowers, are good sorts of volumes to tote
with you&mdash;besides, of course, this camping
manual.</p>

<p>Your kit for the rougher kind of camping,
provided you have guides or men folks
who will carry the food, or &#8220;grub,&#8221; as it is
called in camp parlance, and the blankets, is
now complete. But for the one girl who
goes on this rougher sort of camping expedition,
twenty go into the woods to be happy
in a quite civilized log cabin or shanty.
These girls will be taking a camp box with
them, or a trunk, and can add to their wardrobe.
There is no excuse, however, for adding
the wrong sort of thing. There is no
excuse for wearing unsuitable, unattractive
old rags about camp, clothes which have
served their civilized purpose and have no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page22">[22]</a></span>
fitness for the wilderness life. Let me give
you one other word, from an old timer at
camping, about what you should wear.
<i>Don&#8217;t be foolish and put in any finery.</i> The
finery is as out of place in camp as your
camp boots would be at a garden party at
home. But several middy blouses, more
shoes, more stockings, another skirt, a number
of towels, a few more books&mdash;all will
prove just that much added food for pleasure;
first, last, and always, be comfortable in
camp. There is no reason for being uncomfortable
unless you enjoy discomfort. Anything,
however, over and above what you
actually need will be only a hindrance.
Those who go camping, if they go in the
right spirit, are looking for the simple life;
they want to get rid of paraphernalia, not to
add to it. To learn the happy art of living
close to nature, means stripping away unnecessary
things. There is no place in camp
life for fussiness or display of any sort. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page23">[23]</a></span>
that is beyond the daily need is so much litter
and clutter, making of camp life something
that is a burden, something that is untidy,
uncomfortable, confused. Of no thing
is this more true than of a girl&#8217;s camp
clothes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="fsize80">FOOD</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">T</span><span class="startword0">here</span> are several reasons why the
camp food is almost more important
than any other consideration.
To begin with, most girls are leading a more
active life than they are accustomed to living
at home. This makes them hungry, and, add
to the exercise the natural tonic of invigorating
air, the camper becomes fairly ravenous
at meal time. There are other reasons,
too, why food is an all-important question.
If one is in the real wilderness, it will
be difficult to get. One is obliged, therefore,
to consider carefully beforehand the kinds
of food necessary for a well-provided table
and a well-balanced diet. Another reason
for taking thought about this whole subject
is the portage. All the foods must be toted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page25">[25]</a></span>
in, and not all kinds will prove suitable or
economical in the long run for this sort of
portage. Finally, there is the question of the
ways and means for keeping the food, after
it is once safely in camp, in good condition.</p>

<p>As a rule, when we go on our expeditions
we leave regions where it is easy to get a
great variety of foods. The city or its suburb
or a comfortable country town, is the
place we call home. Our tables are filled
the year long with fresh vegetables, fresh
fruits, fresh meats, and all kinds of bread.
This dietary in all its variety, to which we
have been accustomed at home, is quite impossible
of realization in the camp. We
might just as well make up our minds to
that at once. Yet accustomed to vegetables
and fruits as we are, we need them both in
wholesome quantities. How shall we get
them? Potatoes of course, if the camping
expedition is for any length of time, that is
ten days or more, must be lugged. And lugging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page26">[26]</a></span>
potatoes is heavy work over a trail. As
for the other vegetables and fruits, and even
meats, most people buy large quantities of
tinned articles and so get rid of the whole
question. Personally I think that this is a
great mistake. It was a delight to me to
find in Doctor Breck&#8217;s &#8220;Way of the Woods&#8221;
that he, if obliged to choose between bacon
and dried apples and chocolate, would always
choose the chocolate and dried apples.
And when the question of portage as well
as health enters in, it may be said right here
that it is quite impossible to carry a pack
full of tins. But aside from the comfort of
the guides, a tin-can camp is not likely to be
a wholesome one. I am convinced that tin-can
camping is responsible for whatever ills
people experience when they go into the
woods.</p>

<p>It is quite simple to get different kinds of
dried vegetables and different kinds of dried
fruits&mdash;and the best are none too good&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page27">[27]</a></span>
bulk. At present there are even evaporated
potatoes on the market for campers. Such
dried foods pack and carry best and are most
wholesome. Both white and yellow eye
beans, dried lima beans, peas, whole and
split, onions, evaporated apples, dried
prunes, dried peaches and apricots, rice,
raisins, nuts of all kinds, lemons, oranges,
and even bananas, if they are sufficiently
green, can be quite easily taken into camp.
Various sorts of flour and meal, too, will be
needed. Find out how much it takes to
bake the bread at home and add that to the
length of your stay plus the number of the
campers and plus a little more than you actually
need, and you will be able to work out
the flour problem for yourselves. There
should be then white and graham flour, or
entire wheat, corn meal, pilot bread (memories
of toasted pilot bread in camp can
make one smile from recollected joy), some
rolled oats, cereals like cream of wheat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page28">[28]</a></span>
which carries well, cooks easily, and is
hearty, and various sorts of crackers.</p>

<p>Now the writer does not think meat necessary
in camp. Except for the fish caught and
the birds shot, none need be eaten. All the
meat element or proteid necessary is provided
for in the beans, peas, and nuts. But
it is well to take a flitch of bacon or a few
jars of it to use in broiling or frying the fish
or game. Pork and lard are entirely uncalled-for
in a properly thought out dietary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page29">[29]</a></span><a
id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Sufficient good fresh butter is very much
needed. If campers feel that they must have
other tinned meats, the best kinds to take are
the most expensive, ox tongue, and that sort
of thing. Several months ago four of us
started off on a ten days&#8217; camping expedition
into a very northern wilderness unknown to
us. One of the party, needlessly ambitious,
took a preserved chicken in a glass jar
bought from the finest provision house in
Boston. By the time we reached our destination,
the chicken was anything but preserved.
Indeed, unless all signs failed, it had
already embarked upon a new incarnation.
No arm in the party was long enough to
carry it out and set it on a distant rock for
the skunks to visit. Nor shall I soon forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page30">[30]</a></span>
a certain meat ragout which we concocted in
a Canadian wilderness. We had the ragout,
but alas, we had a good deal else, too, including
a doctor who had to cover half a
county to reach us! Aside from the fact
that people who live in cities and towns eat
altogether too much meat, in camp there is
not only the question of its uselessness, but
also the fact that there are no ways to care
for it properly. Meat makes a dirty camp.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A brother camper says that he thinks even the fish
would feel neglected without pork. On the contrary,
trout are very sensitive to good bacon&mdash;in short, prefer
it to salt pork. If you do not believe this true fish
story, then catch two dozen half pound trout, slice your
bacon thin and draw off the bacon fat. Take out the
bacon, put the fat back into the frying pan&mdash;don&#8217;t burn
yourself&mdash;and pop in one-half dozen trout. After the
first mouthful you will find that my contention that
trout are most sensitive to bacon entirely true. Be sure
to put a little piece of bacon on that first bite. Following
that, all you have to do is to keep on biting
until your share of the two dozen trout is consumed.
Remarkable how those two dozen will fly&mdash;almost as if
the little fellows had turned into birds! The reason I
am opposed to pork and lard camping is that we all
know nowadays how diseased such meat may be. To
go into the woods for health and run any avoidable
risks is folly. Get a flitch of the best bacon and the
best bacon is Ferris bacon. From this you will get
enough fat for all frying purposes; also, in case you
use fat as a substitute for butter, there will be enough
bacon fat for cakes, etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> I cannot emphasize too often the absolute importance
of keeping a <i>clean camp</i>. Mr. Rutger Jewett, to whom
this camping manual and its author are indebted for
many wise suggestions, thinks that it is not always
feasible to burn up everything. &#8220;Every camp,&#8221; he
writes, &#8220;has some empty tin cans. It seems to me that
the best plan in this case is to have a small trench dug,
far enough from the camp to avoid all disagreeable results
and yet not so far away that it is inaccessible.
Here cans and unburnable refuse from the kitchen can
be thrown and kept covered with earth or sand to avoid
flies and odors. Everything that can be burned, should
be.&#8221; The only difficulty in my mind is, in case the
region is hedgehog-infested, that those charming creatures
will form their usual &#8220;bread-line&#8221;&mdash;this time to the
trench&mdash;and add digging to their accomplishments in
gnawing. However! Better rinse out your tin cans;
Sis Hedgehog is less likely to mistake the can for the
original delicacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page31">[31]</a></span></p></div>

<p>All food refuse should be burned up, anyway,
never thrown out into the brush, and it
is difficult to burn meat bones. The girl or
woman who keeps a dirty camp is beneath
contempt. There is likely to be one neighbor,
if not more, in the vicinity of every
camp, who will make things uncomfortable
for the campers. He should be called the
camp pig, and he is the hedgehog. Also his
cousin, the skunk, will hang around to see
what is carelessly thrown out or left for him
to eat. The hedgehog is the greediest, most
unwelcome fellow in the woods, and even the
fact that the poet Robert Browning had one
as a pet will not redeem him in the eyes of
the practical camper. He hangs around any
camp that is not kept clean, gnaws axe
handles which the salty human hand has
touched, licks out tin cans which have not
been rinsed as they should be before they
are thrown away&mdash;in short, he follows up
every bit of camp slackness. There is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page32">[32]</a></span>
one way to keep off hedgehogs and that is
to have an absolutely tidy camp.</p>

<p>In addition to the food stuffs already mentioned,
there are several others which should
be taken in the necessary quantities. Salt
and pepper&mdash;better leave tea and coffee at
home and take cocoa&mdash;soda, sugar, a few
candles (helpful in lighting a fire in wet
weather, as well as for illumination),
matches, in a rubber box if possible, kerosene
if your camp outfit will permit such a
luxury, olive oil, maple syrup for flapjacks,
molasses, condensed and evaporated milk or
milk powder.</p>

<p class="allclear">The articles which need to be cooled can
be kept fresh in a nearby brook. Dead fish,
however, should never be allowed to lie in
water, but should be wrapped up in ferns or
large leaves. If you are camping for any
length of time, by making a little runway out
of a trough you can have freshly flowing
water, cooling butter and other food stuffs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page33">[33]</a><br /><a id="Page34">[34]</a></span>
all the time. Or a receptacle constructed
something like a wire bait box will prove as
good as the flowing water. This sunk into
a cool pond or lake, makes an admirable ice
chest, into which the finny creatures cannot
get. In some rotation which you have decided
upon, the care of the food should receive
the especial attention from one girl
every day. In this way hedgehogs, skunks,
mice, rats, ants, will all be kept at a distance.</p>

<p>There are in addition to these various food
stuffs and their care, as I said in the
first chapter, many articles necessary for
camp life about which we must think.
If you are going off for a few days with a
guide, he will attend to these things for you.
But if you are setting up a camp for yourself,
you will need to have them in mind.
They are, two or three tin pails of convenient
sizes nesting or fitting into one another
so that they can be easily carried, a
tin reflector baker for outdoor cooking, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page35">[35]</a></span>
coffee pot if you are foolish enough to take
coffee, enameled ware plates and cups, basins,
pans, dishpans, a dishmop, a chain pot-cleaner,
a double boiler, a broiler, knives
and forks, spoons big and little, pepper and
salt shakers, flour sifter, a rotary can opener,
a frypan, long-handled and short-handled, a
carving knife and a fish knife if you intend
to do a great deal of fishing. There are
many kinds of cooking kits. There is
a good one for four persons which may be
obtained at about six dollars from any large
hardware dealer. Add to these things
which have been mentioned fish hooks, a lantern,
lantern wicks, nails of different sizes, a
hammer&mdash;don&#8217;t forget the hammer!&mdash;toilet
paper, woolen blankets, mosquito netting (if
it is a mosquito-infested district), fly dope to
rub on hands and face, oilcloth for camp
table, some twine and some tacks.</p>

<p>Equipped with these articles and what you
carry in your knapsacks and what you wear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page36">[36]</a></span>
there is almost no wilderness in which a girl
cannot have a good time, improve her health,
and be the wiser for having entered the wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="fsize80">COOK AND COOKEE</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">A</span><span class="startword0">ny</span> of you who have ever seen a
lumber camp will remember something
of how it is constructed.
Separate from the main building is the superintendent&#8217;s
office, a little cabin built usually
of tar paper and light timber; then there
is the hovel, as it is called, in which the
horses and cows are stabled, and finally there
is the big main building where the crew sleep
and eat. But separated from the men&#8217;s dormitory
by a passageway that leads into the
outdoors, is the big room used as kitchen and
dining room. Just beyond this and opening
into the kitchen, is the room in which the
cook and his assistant sleep.</p>

<p>In these two rooms in the wilderness, cook
and cookee reign supreme. They are the
most important persons in the camp. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page38">[38]</a></span>
are the best paid. Their word is law. They
have a room by themselves, partly for cleanliness&#8217;
sake, and also because the success of
the whole camp depends more or less upon
them. But it is not alone the lumber cook
and cookee who make or mar the success of
camp life. It is also the cook in the hotel
camp, and even more, the cook in the hundreds
of thousands of home camps which
make glad our holiday season. The king
pin of life, physically&mdash;and I might say morally,
too, for wherever the health is excellent
the morals are likely to be so&mdash;is good,
pure, abundant food, properly cooked.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the art of cooking put so to
the test as in camp. You have less to do
with; you have bigger appetites to do for
and more need physically for the food you
eat. There is one article which, if you are
planning to do more cooking out of doors
than can be done in a pot of water over a
fire and a frying pan, you must have, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page39">[39]</a></span>
that is a tin reflector baker. One year I
was caught in the steadiest downpour which
I have ever known while camping. We were
on the West Branch of the Penobscot, in an
isolated region at the foot of Mount Katahdin,
the highest mountain in the state of
Maine. We had nothing to sleep under except
a tent fly, and the rain drove in night
and day, keeping us thoroughly wet. Our
Indian guides managed to make the fire go
in front of the leaky tar paper shack which
we used as a kitchen. There was nothing
we could do profitably but cook, so I amused
myself cooking. I managed to bake, in the
rain, before an open fire, within that little
tin reflector baker, some tarts which were
very successful. Many other articles, too,
were cooked and came out thoroughly edible.
That was indeed a test of the little
tin baker which I shall never forget.</p>

<p>There is one sort of kindling fuel unfailingly
useful in the woods. Even the rain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page40">[40]</a></span>
cannot dampen its blaze. The fuel to which
I refer is birch-bark. It will light when
nothing else will light, I suppose because of
the large amount of oil in it. Even when
you take it wet from the ground, instead of
stripping it from a tree&mdash;and you can always
get an inner layer of dry birch-bark
from a tree&mdash;it will burn and kindle a good
fire. A box of matches is a natural possession
for a boy, but I am not so sure that
this is true with a girl. Every camper
should have a hard rubber box of matches
in his possession, should know where it is&mdash;always
in an inside pocket if possible&mdash;and
should take good care of it. But to go back
to that wet day and the shining little tin
baker on the West Branch at the foot of
Katahdin. There are some woods which
are good for rapid, quiet burning and some
that are poor, as every experienced woodsman
will tell you. You must keep, until you
know it by heart, a check list of different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page41">[41]</a></span>
kinds of wood, just as you must keep a food
check list and other check lists. If it is a big
camp fire, which for jollity&#8217;s sake or the sake
of warmth you wish to start, and do not care
to keep going for a long time, almost any
sort of wood will serve. Brush tops or
slashings will do quite well to start such a
blaze. Hickory is the best wood for use
when you want a deep, quiet hot fire for
cooking. There is scarcely any better wood
for the camp cook to use than apple, but that
most campers are not likely to be able to
get. The green woods which burn most
readily and are best to start a quick fire with
are birch, white and black, hard maple, ash,
oak, and hickory. The older the tree the
more pitch there will be in it, and the pitch
is an effective and noisy kindler of fires.
Hemlock, spruce, cedar, and the larch, all
snap badly. I have been obliged to use a
good deal of cedar in an open Franklin in
my camp study this last summer. It has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page42">[42]</a></span>
never been safe to leave one of these cedar
fires without shutting the doors of the Franklin
stove. I have known the burning cedar
to hurl sparks the entire length of the cabin.
As the chinking is excelsior, you can imagine
what one of those cedar sparks would
do if it snapped onto a bit of the excelsior.
Cabins not chinked with excelsior are usually
chinked with moss, which is almost as
inflammable. With woods that snap, the
camper can never be too careful, and no fire
made of snappy wood should ever be built
near a cabin or a tent. One spark, and it
might be too late to check the quickly spreading
fire.</p>

<p>There is another thing about which the
camp cook and all girls camping need to be
very careful, and that is the drinking water.
One cannot be too exacting in this matter, too
scrupulous, too clean. Provided there is
spring or lake water about whose purity
there can be no doubt, the question is settled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page43">[43]</a></span>
In this connection it may be said of drinking:
when in doubt, don&#8217;t. A quarter of a
mile, a half a mile, a mile, is none too far
to go to get the right sort of water. This
can be done in squads, one set of girls going
one day and another the next. This water
must be used for the cooking, too. If there
is any doubt about the water supply, it should
be filtered or boiled or both. Go into camp
ready to make pure water one of your chief
considerations, and never, under any circumstances,
drink water or eat anything, even
fish, which may have been contaminated by
sewage. How vigilant one has to be about
this an experience of my own, some months
ago, will show you. The pond to which we
were going was indeed in the wilderness, inaccessible
except by canoe. I had walked
one long &#8220;carry,&#8221; paddled across a good-sized
pond&mdash;two miles wide, I think&mdash;and
had been poling up some quick-water. The
&#8220;rips&#8221; were low, and scratching would better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page44">[44]</a></span>
describe the efforts to which we were put
than poling does. My hands became so dry
from the incessant work with the pole that
I had to wet them to get any purchase on it
at all. A greased pig could not have been
harder to hold than that pole. When finally
we reached the little mountain-surrounded
pond for which we were making up the
quickwater, I was hot, breathless, exhausted.
I could think of only one thing, and that was
a drink of water. There were a few camps
about the lake, but it did not enter my mind
that they would empty their sewage into it
and take their fish and their water out of it.
Yet after I had drunk, the first thing I noticed,
in passing one camp, was that they unmistakably
did empty their sewage into the
pond. No evidence was lacking that it all
went into the water not far from where I
had taken a drink. It is not a pleasant subject,
but it is one about which it is necessary
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to take in your kit some place,
unless you are an accomplished cook and
have it all in your head, a small, good cook
book. The first thing which you should recollect
about the rougher sort of camping is
that you will have no fresh eggs or milk with
which to do your cooking. You should have
recipes for making your biscuits, johnnycake,
bread, corn-pone, cakes, flapjacks, cookies,
potato soup, bean soup, pea soup, chowder,
rice pudding, and for cooking game and
fish. In that veteran book for campers,
&#8220;The Way of the Woods,&#8221; some good
recipes for the necessary dishes are given.
Whatever dishes you plan to make in the
wilderness should be simple and few. Anything
beyond the simplest dietary is not in
the spirit of camp life, and will only detract
from rather than add to the general
pleasure. Those recipes which seem to me
absolutely necessary I will give to you in the
next chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="fsize80">LOG-CABIN COOKERY</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">D</span><span class="startword0">id</span> you ever get to a camp fire or
log-cabin stove at eleven o&#8217;clock
and know that there must be a
hearty meal by twelve? I have lots of
times. The only way to do, if one must
meet these emergencies on short notice, is to
have what I call &#8220;stock&#8221; on hand. In using
this word I do not mean soup stock, either.
What I mean is that there must be some
vegetables or cereals or other articles of food
at least partially prepared for eating.</p>

<p>I remember one summer when I was very
busy with my writing. I was chief cook and
bottle washer, besides being my own secretary,
and I had three members in my family
to look out for&mdash;a friend with a hearty appetite,
a big dog with a no less hearty appetite
and a rather greedy little Maine cat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page47">[47]</a></span>
The question was how to carry on the work
which was properly my own and at the same
time attend to cooking and other household
work. I hit upon a plan which served excellently
with me. I do not recommend it to
any one else, especially to girls who will be
going into the woods for a vacation and will
have no duties except those connected with
their camp life. But this plan of mine demonstrated
to me once and for all that, even
if one is very busy, it is possible to have a
bountifully supplied table.</p>

<p>The first day I tried the experiment I
went into the kitchen at eleven o&#8217;clock.
Never had I been more tired of the everlasting
question of what to have to eat. It
seemed to me that there was never any other
question except that one, and I determined,
with considerable savage feeling, to escape
from it. At eleven o&#8217;clock I chopped my
own kindling, started my own fire, and began
twirling the saucepans, frying pans and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page48">[48]</a></span>
baking tins which I wanted to use. I was
set upon cooking up enough food to last for
three or four days, and I did. At two
o&#8217;clock not only was all the food cooked and
set away for future consumption, but also
we had eaten our dinner. In that time what
had I prepared? There was a big double
boiler full of <i>corn meal</i>. After this had been
thoroughly boiled in five times its bulk of
water and a large tablespoonful of salt, I
poured it out into baking tins and set it
away to cool. Various things can be done
with this stock; among others, once cool, it
slices beautifully, and is delicious fried in
butter or in bacon fat, and satisfying to the
hungriest camper. Also a large panful of
<i>rice</i> had been cooked. This had been set
aside to be used in <i>croquettes</i>, in <i>rice puddings</i>
and to be served plain with milk at
supper time. So much for the rice and the
corn meal. I had broken up in two-inch
pieces a large panful of <i>macaroni</i>. This was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page49">[49]</a></span>
boiled in salt water, part of it cooled and set
away for further use, some of it mixed with
a canful of tomato and stewed for our dinner
and the rest baked with tomato and
bread crumbs, to be heated up for another
day. On top of the stove, too, I had a mammoth
<i>vegetable stew</i>. In this stew were potatoes,
carrots, parsnips, cabbage, beets,
turnips, plenty of butter and plenty of salt.
The stew remained on the stove, carefully
covered, during the time that the fire was
lighted and was put on again the next day
to complete the cooking, for it takes long
boiling to make a really good stew. Inside
the oven were two big platefuls of <i>apples</i>
baking. These had been properly cored and
the centers filled with butter and sugar and
cinnamon; also two or three dozen potatoes
were baking in the oven, some of which
would serve for quick frying on another day.
In addition to the food mentioned, I set a
large two-quart bowl full of lemon jelly with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page50">[50]</a></span>
vegetable gelatin. It took me exactly fifteen
minutes to make this jelly and during that
time I was giving my attention to other
things besides. I made also a panful of
baking powder biscuits which, considering
the way they were hustled about, behaved
themselves in a most long-suffering and commendable
fashion, turning out to be good
biscuits after all.</p>

<p>Now, the import of all this is that, with
planning, a little practice and some hopping
about, a good deal of cooking and preparation
of food can be done in a short time.
Unnecessary &#8220;fussing&#8221; about the cooking is
not desirable in camp life. The simpler that
life can be made and kept the better. The
more we can get away from unwholesome
condiments, highly seasoned foods, too much
meat eating and coffee drinking, too many
sweets and pastries, the better. The girl
who goes into the woods with the idea of
having all the luxuries&mdash;many of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page51">[51]</a></span>
wholly unnecessary and some of them undesirable&mdash;of
her home life, is no true &#8220;sport.&#8221;
The grand object for which we cook in camp
is a good appetite and that needs no sauce
and sweets.</p>

<p>What are some of the recipes a girl should
have with her for log-cabin cooking? In
the first place, we must take with us a good
recipe for <i>bread-making</i>. There are so many
I will give none. The best one to have is
the one used at home, but let me say here
that no flour so answers all dietetic needs in
the woods as entire wheat. Delicious baking
powder biscuits can be made from it as
well as bread. Also know how to <i>boil a potato</i>.
You think this is a matter of no importance?
It would surprise you then,
wouldn&#8217;t it, to know that there are some people
devoting all of their time teaching the
ignorant and the poor the art of boiling a
potato. You can boil all the good out of it
and make it almost worthless as food, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page52">[52]</a></span>
well as untempting, or you can cook it properly,
making it everything it ought to be.
Know, too, how to <i>clean a fish</i>. Oh, dear,
you never could do that! It makes you
shiver to think of such a thing. Very well
then, camp is no place for you. Your
squeamishness which might seem attractive
some place else will only be silly there,
making you a dead weight about somebody
else&#8217;s neck. Does your brother Boy Scout
know how to clean a fish? Did you ever
know a real boy who did not know how to
clean a fish? Why not a real girl, then, perhaps
a Camp Fire Girl? Oh, but the cook&mdash;no,
you will be the cook in camp or the
assistant cook. Then get your brother to
show you how to cut off its head and to
scale it, if it is a scaly fish, how to slit it
open, taking out the entrails, how to wash
it thoroughly and dry it, how to dip it in
flour or meal and to drop it into the sizzling
frying pan, how to turn it and then finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page53">[53]</a></span>
the moment when, crisp and brown, it should
be taken out and served. Know, too, how to
pluck and clean a partridge.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> One day this
last summer I went up the cut behind my
camp, intent upon finding a partridge for
our supper. I hadn&#8217;t gone far before I
found one and with the second shot of my
rifle brought the poor fellow down. I took
him home to the cook whom I had with me
then, the daughter of a neighboring farmer.
I gave her the bird and told her to get him
ready for supper. She said she couldn&#8217;t;
she didn&#8217;t know how.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> If your mother and brother have not taught you
how to <i>clean fish</i> and <i>pluck partridge</i>, then it would be
best to go to the butcher and fishman and take lessons
of them. If it is possible to go on your first expedition
with a good guide, that will settle the whole difficulty,
for your guide will know the best way and be
glad to teach you.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know how?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said that she did not know how to
pluck and clean a partridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;you know how to
clean a chicken, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy me, no!&#8221; she objected, looking
pale and silly. &#8220;Mother always cleans the
chickens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother always cleans the chickens!
Mother does a good deal too much of the
things that are somewhat unpleasant in this
American home life of ours. This girl had
been perfectly willing that her mother
should do all the work which seemed to her
too disagreeable or unpleasant to do herself.
But I am glad to say, and her mother ought
to have been grateful to me, she helped in
dressing that partridge and I did not care a
tinker when, after it had been cooked, she
seemed to feel too badly to eat very much of
it. I wonder how her mother had felt after
all the hundreds of chickens she had killed,
plucked, cleaned and cooked for that very
girl of hers.</p>

<p>You must know, too, how to <i>boil an egg</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page55">[55]</a></span>
and do not do as I saw that same incompetent
farmer&#8217;s daughter do&mdash;I suppose because
she had left almost everything to her
very competent mother&mdash;do not boil your
eggs in the tea kettle. The water in the
tea kettle should be kept as clean and fresh
as possible. There is no excuse for a <i>dirty
tea kettle</i>. We should be able in the woods,
too, to know how to scramble eggs, if one
has them, and to make omelets, and to boil
corn meal, and the best ways for cooking
rice and of baking fruits. Good apple pies,
too, if you can make pastry without too
much trouble, will not go amiss.</p>

<p>There are a few recipes which you must
get out of the home cook book, besides the
few which I will now give you. <i>Baking powder
biscuits</i> are not easy to make. Even
very good cooks sometimes do not have success
with them. Do not be discouraged if at
your first effort you should fail. Keep on
trying. You must learn, for I think it can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page56">[56]</a></span>
be said that baking powder biscuits constitute
the bread of the woods. I know farming
families in northern Maine who do not
know what it is to make raised bread. They
have nothing but baking powder or soda and
cream of tartar bread. Use one quart of
sifted flour, one teaspoonful of salt, three
rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder,
one large tablespoonful of butter and enough
milk, evaporated or powdered milk, or fresh
if you have it, to make a soft dough. Mix
these things in the order in which they are
given, and when the dough is stiff enough to
be cut with the top of a baking powder can
or a biscuit cutter, sprinkle your bread and
also your rolling pin with flour and roll out
the dough. It will depend upon your oven
somewhat, but probably it will take you from
ten to fifteen minutes to bake these biscuits.</p>

<p>A recipe for corn meal cake, too, should
be in one&#8217;s camp kit. The simpler that recipe
the better. Some forms of <i>corn bread</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page57">[57]</a></span>
take so long to prepare that they are not
suitable for the woods. The one I shall give
you will prove practicable. You might take
one from your own home cook book, too, if
you wish. Mix the ingredients in the order
in which they are set down and bake them in
a moderately hot oven. If you haven&#8217;t anything
else to use, bread tins a third full will
serve. One cup of whole corn meal, a half
a teaspoonful of salt and a cup of sugar, a
whole cup of flour, three teaspoonfuls of
baking powder&mdash;these should be level&mdash;one
egg, one cup of milk and a tablespoonful of
melted butter.</p>

<p><i>Pancakes</i> you must also know how to
make. One can&#8217;t very well get along in the
wilderness without some sort of griddle
cake, the simpler the better. Sour milk pancakes
are the best, particularly as it is not
necessary to use eggs if one has sour milk,
but that is not always feasible, as frequently
you will have to use evaporated milk. Mix<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page58">[58]</a></span>
a pint of flour, a half a teaspoonful of salt,
a teaspoonful of soda, one pint of sour
milk, and two eggs thoroughly beaten. See
that your frying pan, for in camp you will
cook your cakes in the frying pan, has been
on the stove some time. Grease it thoroughly
with bacon fat or butter; never use
lard unless you have to. Cook the cakes
thoroughly. You will find turning your first
hot cakes something of an adventure.</p>

<p>There should also be among our log-cabin
recipes some directions for telling you how
to make at least two kinds of <i>nourishing
soup</i> without stock. Soup with stock in camp
life is not practicable. Pea or bean soups
are the most satisfying and satisfactory.
The peas or beans must be soaked in cold
water over night. Pea or bean soups take a
long time to make, so that it is not always
practicable to have them in camp. I will
give you a recipe for <i>split pea soup</i>. Take
with you, if you are likely to need it, also, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page59">[59]</a></span>
recipe for black bean soup. After soaking
over night, pour the water off the split
peas and add to the cup of peas three pints
of cold water. Do not let the liquid catch
on the sides of the pan in which the peas are
simmering. When the peas are soft, rub
them through a strainer and put them on to
boil again, adding one tablespoonful of butter,
one of flour, one-half teaspoonful of
sugar and a teaspoonful of salt. You don&#8217;t
need pepper&mdash;better leave pepper at home
and if you get so that you don&#8217;t miss it in
camp, then you need never use it again. It
is wretched stuff, anyway, doing more to
harm the human stomach than almost any
other food poison in use.</p>

<p><i>Baked beans</i>, too, make a prime dish for
camp life, partly, I suppose, because, like
corn meal and pea and bean soups, potatoes
and the heartier kinds of food, they are so
satisfying to the camper&#8217;s appetite. It isn&#8217;t
necessary to cook your beans with pork, substitute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page60">[60]</a></span>
some kind of nut butter, peanut butter
or almond butter, or plenty of fresh dairy
butter. The quart of pea beans should be
soaked in cold water over night. In the
morning these beans must be put into fresh
water and allowed to cook until they are soft
but not broken. Empty them into a colander
and then put them in the bean pot, or if
you haven&#8217;t a bean pot, a deep baking dish
will do. Put in a quarter of a cup of molasses
and a half cup of butter and pour a
little hot water over the beans. Keep them
all day long in an oven that is not too hot.
Don&#8217;t put any mustard in your beans; mustard
is as great an enemy to the human
stomach as pepper, and that is saying a good
deal.</p>

<p>Against a rainy day when you may wish to
amuse yourselves with additional dishes, or
a hungry day when you are cold and ravenous,
I will add a few more recipes. <i>Corn
pone</i> is good. This is just corn bread baked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page61">[61]</a></span>
on a heated stone propped up before the fire
till the surface is seared. Then cover with
hot ashes and let it bake in them for twenty
minutes. After that dust your cake and eat
it. I have told you how to make <i>corn meal
mush</i>. With butter and sugar (in case you
have no milk) it is excellent. What do you
say to some <i>buckwheat cakes</i> on a cold,
rainy night? If you say &#8220;yes,&#8221; all you have
to do is to mix the self-raising buckwheat
flour with a proper amount of water and
drop some good-sized spoonfuls into a hot,
greased frying-pan. The turning of hot
cakes is the next best fun to eating them.
Mash your boiled potatoes, season with butter
and salt and milk if you have it. After
that, call it <i>mashed potato</i>. It is good to eat
and keeps well for pat&eacute; cakes or a scallop.
When hungry, <i>fried potatoes</i> can be eaten
with impunity by the most zealous dietarian.
Fried potatoes are naughty but nice. <i>Mushrooms</i>
are nice, too, but dangerous. If you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page62">[62]</a></span>
have a trained botanist or someone who has
<i>always</i> gathered mushrooms for eating, then
perhaps it will be safe to cook this bounty
the woods spread before you. If you must
have <i>bacon</i> you cannot get bacon that is <i>too</i>
good. <i>Ferris bacon and hams</i> are the finest
and most reliable cured pork in this country.
And since we are speaking of pork and therefore
of frying, let me give you one caution:
<i>Never use the frying-pan when you can avoid
doing so.</i> No amount of care can make fried
foods altogether wholesome. Even an out-of-door
life cannot altogether counteract the
bad effects of fried food. You can make
good <i>broth</i> from small diced bits of game or
whatever meat you have, when the meat is
tender, add vegetables and allow the whole
to boil for some time. <i>Chowder</i>, too, is a
standard dish for camp life. Take out the
bones from the fish and cut up fish into small
pieces. &#8220;Cover the bottom of the kettle with
layers in the following order: slices of pork,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page63">[63]</a></span>
sliced raw potatoes, chopped onions, fish,
hard biscuit soaked (or bread). Repeat this
(leaving out pork) until the pot is nearly
full. Season each layer. Cover barely with
water and cook an hour or so over a very
slow fire. When thick stir gently. Any
other ingredients that are at hand may be
added.&#8221; (Seneca&#8217;s &#8220;Canoe and Camp Cookery&#8221;
and Breck&#8217;s &#8220;Way of the Woods.&#8221;) A
<i>white sauce</i> for fish and other purposes will
be found useful. Melt tablespoonful of butter
in saucepan; stir in dessert-spoonful of
flour; add <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> teaspoonful salt; mix with a
cup of milk. Except for the ginger, <i>gingerbread</i>
is not a bad cake for the woods. One
cup of molasses, one cup of sugar, one teaspoonful
of ginger, one teaspoonful of soda,
one cup of hot water, flour enough to form a
medium batter, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> cup melted butter, and a
little cinnamon will make it. You might
experiment with <i>Chinese tea cakes</i> made with
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> cup butter, one cup brown sugar, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
teaspoonful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page64">[64]</a></span>
soda, one tablespoonful of cold
water, and one cup of flour. Shape this mixture
into small balls, and put on buttered
sheets and bake in a hot oven. <i>Molasses
cookies</i> are good and substantial, not a bad
thing to put in the duffle bag on a day&#8217;s
tramp. Use one cup of molasses, one teaspoonful
of ginger, one teaspoonful of soda,
two teaspoonfuls of warm water or milk, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
cup of butter, enough flour to mix soft. Dissolve
the soda in milk. Roll dough one-third
of an inch thick and cut in small rounds.
Two well known candy recipes will add
to the pleasures of a rainy day and a
sweet tooth. <i>Penuche</i>: Two cups brown
sugar, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> cup milk, butter size of a small nut,
pinch of salt, one teaspoonful of vanilla, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
cup walnut meats. Boil the first four ingredients
until soft ball is formed when dropped
in water. Then add vanilla and nuts, and
beat until cool and creamy. <i>Fudge</i>: 2 cups
sugar, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> cup milk, 3 tablespoonfuls cocoa, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page65">[65]</a></span>
pinch of salt, butter size of small nut, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> cup
walnut meats if desired. Cook same as
penuche.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in conclusion, I should advise
you to learn something about the <i>boiling of
vegetables</i> and tell you not to cut the top off
a <i>beet</i> unless you want to see it bleed, and
lose the better part of it. Put your beet in,
top and all. When cooked, it will be time
enough to cut it and pare it. Be sure if you
cook <i>cabbage</i> that it is cooked long enough,
and has become thoroughly tender. The
same is true with <i>parsnips</i> and <i>carrots</i>. If
you are in a hurry slice up your carrots or
parsnips or cabbage or potatoes and they
will cook more rapidly.</p>

<p>Be sure that your camp dietary has plenty
of <i>stewed fruits</i> in it. That will be so much
to the good in the camp health. A bottle of
<i>olive oil</i> also will prove a great resource; in
fact, a can of olive oil would be even more
practical and the oil is always capital food.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page66">[66]</a></span>
Although the most elaborate recipes are
given for making a <i>mayonnaise dressing</i> it
is really very simple to make, and once made
can be kept on hand as &#8220;stock.&#8221; I have
been making mayonnaise since I was a little
girl, and, as I cook something like the proverbial
darky, I do not know that I am able
to give you any hard and fast directions for
making the dressing. With me it is an affair
of impulse; I use either the white of an
egg or the whole egg, it does not make any
difference&mdash;the shell you will not find palatable&mdash;beating
it up thoroughly, gradually
adding the oil, putting in a little lemon juice
from time to time and plenty of salt. Cayenne
pepper is ordinarily used in mayonnaise,
but if the dressing is properly seasoned
with salt and lemon it needs neither
cayenne nor mustard. What it does need is
thorough and long beating, a cool place, and
a few minutes in which to harden after it is
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>You will learn one thing in the woods
which perhaps will be a surprise. In that
life it is men who are the good cooks. Indeed,
it is surprising how much cleverness
men show in domestic ways when they are
left to their own devices and how helpless
they become as soon as a woman is around.
If you go astray any woodsman, any guide,
almost any &#8220;sport&#8221; can help you out in the
mysteries of cooking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE PLACE TO CAMP</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">F</span><span class="startword0">or</span> most girls the place in which they
are to camp will depend very largely
on the locality in which they live.
But few people want to, or feel that they
can, travel long distances to secure their
ideal camping ground. Yet there are some
things about the place to camp which most
of us can demand and get. When one has
learned a little of the art of camping, it is
really surprising how many good camping
grounds may be found in one&#8217;s own immediate
neighborhood.</p>

<p>The first question to be decided is the sort
of expedition which we shall undertake. Are
we going to rough it for a few days or a
couple of weeks, taking things as they come
and not expecting any of the comforts we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page69">[69]</a></span>
ordinarily have? Are we going to sleep in
the open, cook and eat in the open? If we
are to &#8220;pack&#8221; all that we shall have along
with us, is it to be a river trip or a lake
trip in a canoe? Is it to be a walking expedition
or with horses? The least expensive
item will prove to be the one that involves
taking the fewest number of guides, and
which is carried out on shank&#8217;s mare. Every
expedition which is continually on the move
through an isolated and rough country
should be equipped with one guide to each
two people. If it is a stationary camp, one
guide to three or four people will be the
minimum. But that <i>is</i> the minimum. Registered
guides command big pay for their
work, usually about three dollars a day, and
their food and lodging provided for them.</p>

<p>When we cannot make up for our oversight
or mistakes or stupidities by trotting
around the corner to procure what we have
forgotten, or taking up a telephone and ordering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page70">[70]</a></span>
it sent to us, or sending a message to
the doctor, who must come because we have
exhausted ourselves, or got indigestion from
badly planned and badly cooked food, it behooves
us to be careful. Only a word to the
wise is necessary. To use a slang phrase
which contains in a nutshell almost all that
need be said on the subject: <i>don&#8217;t bite off
more than you can chew</i>. If you are starting
out on a strenuous walking expedition,
be sure that all in the party are accustomed
to hard walking and are properly shod and
in fit condition for the work. With these
requirements attended to, your duffle bags
full of the right shelter and food stuff, a
capable man or capable men in charge of
the expedition, there is nothing in the world
which could be better for a group of healthy
girls than a walking tour. I have walked
scores of miles with my own little pack on
my back and been all the better for the hard
work and the hard living. More of us need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page71">[71]</a></span>
hard living as a corrective for our over-civilized
lives than we need luxuries. If it is
a canoe trip, it is well for several members
of the party to know how to paddle and even
to pole up over the &#8220;rips&#8221; of quickwater.
Thank fortune that the girl of to-day has
sloughed off some of the inane traits supposed
to be excusably feminine, such, for example,
as screaming when frightened. The
modern girl doesn&#8217;t need to be told that
screaming and jumping when she goes down
her first quickwater in a canoe are distinctly
out of order. I remember one experience in
quickwater when I was not sure but that I
should have to jump literally for my life. In
some way the Indian with whom I was had
got his setting pole caught in the rocks, and
we were swung around sidewise over a four-foot
drop of raging water. If the pole
loosened before we could get the nose of the
canoe pointed down stream, the end was inevitable.
No one could have lived in those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page72">[72]</a></span>
raging waters. The canoe would have been
rolled over and we pounded to pieces or
crushed upon the rocks. We clawed the
racing water madly with the paddles, which
seemed, for all the good they could do, more
like toothpicks than paddles. But slowly,
inch by inch, straining every muscle, we managed
to work around. Needless to say, we
escaped unharmed, except for a wetting. In
this case as always, a miss is as good as a
mile&mdash;a little &#8220;miss&#8221; which was most cordially
received by me. The Indian said
nothing, but I noticed that there was some
expression in his face while this adventure
was going on, and that is saying a good deal
for an Indian.</p>

<p>After some of the questions connected
with the kind of expedition are thought out,
it is just as well to consider the place in
which one wishes to camp, for that will determine
much else. All things being equal,
it is well to get a sharp contrast in locality,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page73">[73]</a></span>
because that means the maximum of change
and tonic. In my experience there are only
two kinds of camping grounds to be avoided&mdash;no,
I will say three. First, there is
swampy, malarial land, infested by mosquitoes
and other unpleasant creatures.
Second, there is ground on which no water
can be found. Camp life without access to
water is an impossible proposition. And
thirdly&mdash;a possibility fortunately which does
not occur in many localities&mdash;ground that is
infested by venomous snakes is unsafe. Even
in so beautiful and fertile a region as the
Connecticut Valley, where I live when not at
my camp in the Moosehead region, and
where I frequently go camping, the question
of snakes has to be taken into consideration.
I have encountered both the rattlesnake and
the copperhead, two of the most deadly reptiles
known, in the Connecticut Valley.</p>

<p>If, when you are at home, you live on land
that is low, and high land is accessible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page74">[74]</a></span>
your expedition, I think you cannot do better
than camp on the hills or the mountains.
On the other hand, if you are ordinarily accustomed
to living among the hills, a camping
ground on low land by sea or lake will
bring you the greatest change. Some girls
might prefer to camp deep in the very heart
of the woods. Personally I do not. I think
it is likely to be very damp there, and to be
so enclosed on every side that the life grows
dull. I like a camping ground on the shore
of a pond, or on a hill side with a big outlook,
or at the mouth of a river.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful camping
grounds I have ever known is in a deserted
apple orchard miles away from civilization.
Once upon a time there was a farm there,
but the buildings were all burned down. Remote,
perfect, sheltered, I often think the
original Garden of Eden could not have been
more beautiful. And there is the original
apple tree, but in this case most seductive as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page75">[75]</a></span>
apple sauce. You make a mistake if, before
you get up your camp appetite, you assume
that apple sauce need not be taken into account.
When your camp appetite is up, you
will find that the original sauce on buttered
bread will put you into the original paradisaic
mood. And there are all sorts of extension
of the apple that are as good as they
are harmless, apple pie, apple dumpling, apple
cake, and baked apples.</p>

<p>It may not seem romantic to you, but you
will find it practical and, after all, delightful
to camp a mile or so away from a good
farmhouse, as far out on the edge of the
wilderness as you can get, for, the farm
within walking distance, it is possible to have
a great variety of food: fresh milk and
cream, eggs, an occasional chicken, new potatoes,
and other vegetables in season. With
the farm nearby, you can say, as in the
&#8220;Merry Wives of Windsor&#8221;: &#8220;Let the sky
rain potatoes!&#8221; and you have your wish fulfilled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page76">[76]</a></span>
It is probable, too, that the farmer
in such an isolated region will be glad to
help in pitching the tents, in lugging whatever
needs to be lugged from the nearest
village or station, in making camp generally
and, finally, in striking the camp. It is likely
that for a reasonable sum he will be glad to
let you have one of his nice big farm Dobbins
and an old buggy for cruising around
the country. In any event, choose ground
that affords a good run-off and is dry; select
a sheltered spot where the winds will not
beat heavily upon your tents, and never forget
that clean drinking water is one of the
first essentials. Keep away from contaminated
wells and all uncertain supplies. With
these injunctions in mind, you can find only
a happy, healthful, invigorating home among
the &#8220;primitive pines&#8221; or under the original
apple tree.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="fsize80">CAMP FIRES</span></h2>

<p class="fsize90">&#8220;The way to prevent big fires is to put them out while
they are small.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chief Forester Graves.</span></p>

<p class="chapstart blankbefore2"><span class="firstletter">L</span><span class="startword0">ightly</span> do we go into the woods,
bent upon a holiday. There we
kindle a fire over which we are
to cook our camp supper. How good it all
smells, the wood smoke, the odor of the
frying bacon and fish and potatoes; how
good in the crisp evening air the warmth of
the camp fire feels; and above all, how beautiful
everything is, the deep plumy branches
on whose lower sides shadows from the firelight
dance, the depth of darkness beyond
the reach of the illuminating flame, the rich
strange hue of the soft grass and moss on
which we are sitting! It is all beautiful with
not a suggestion of evil or terror about it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page78">[78]</a></span>
and yet, unchecked, there is a demon of destruction
in that jolly little camp fire before
which we sit. Now the supper! Nothing
ever tasted better, nothing can ever taste so
good again, the fish and bacon done to a
turn, the potatoes lying an inviting brown
in the frying pan, and the hot cocoa, made
with condensed milk, steaming up into the
cool evening air.</p>

<p>After supper we lie about the fire and
sing or dream. Perhaps some one tells a
story. The hours go so rapidly that we do
not know where they have gone. And when
the evening is over? The fire is still glowing,
a bed of bright coral coals and gray ash.
The fire will just go out if we leave it. Besides,
we haven&#8217;t time to fetch water to put
it out with. No, nine chances out of ten, if
we leave the fire it will not go out, but smoulder
on, and a breeze coming up in the night
or at dawn, the fire springs into flame again,
catching on the surrounding dry grass and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page79">[79]</a><br /><a id="Page80">[80]</a></span>
pine needles. Soon, incredibly soon, it begins
to leap up the trunks of trees. Before
we know it, it is springing from tree to tree,
faster than a man can leap or run.</p>

<p>In dry weather you and I could go out into
the woods anywhere, and with a match not
much bigger than a good-sized darning
needle, set a blaze that would sweep over a
whole county, or from county to county, or
from state to state. Millions of dollars&#8217;
worth of damage would be done, and the
chances are that the careless, wanton act
would be the means of having us put into
prison&mdash;which is precisely where, given such
circumstances, we should be.</p>

<p>Have we ever stopped to think for a moment,
we who camp so joyfully, what loss
and injury such carelessness on our part may
mean to a whole community? To begin
with, there are the forests themselves, and
all they represent in actual timber, in promise
for future growth, and in security for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page81">[81]</a></span>
rain supply. Then in fighting the fire thousands
of dollars&#8217; worth of wages will have
to be paid and hundreds of men&#8217;s lives will
be in danger. The sweep and fury of such
forest fires, unless one has lived in the neighborhood
of one as I have, is beyond the comprehension
or the imagination. Burning
brands are blown sixty feet and more over
the tops of the highest trees and the heads
of the men who are fighting the fire. Before
they can check the blaze of the fire
nearest them, one beyond them has already
been started.</p>

<p>Also there are the life aspects, big and
small, of such a fire. Not only are the lives
of the men who fight the blaze endangered,
but all the homes, camps, farmhouses, villages,
and their inmates are in imminent risk.
What it has taken others years to gather together,
to construct, may be swept away in
a few hours. Helpless old people, equally
helpless little children&mdash;all may be burned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond this question of human life, which
every one will admit is a very great one, is
still another which, I am sorry to say, will
not seem so important to some girls. Maybe
it is not, but if you have ever heard the
screams of an animal, terrified by fire, being
burned to death, as I have; if you have ever
heard the blind frenzied terror of the stampede
which takes place, the beating of hoofs
and the screams of creatures that are trying
to escape, but do not know how, as I have
heard them&mdash;then you will have a new sense
of the tragedy which a forest fire means to
the creatures of the forest. Of a forest fire
it may be said, as of an evil, that there is
absolutely no good in it: it is all bad, all devastating,
all injurious.</p>

<p>In a forest fire scores, hundreds, thousands
of wild creatures are killed, those little
creatures which, given the chance, are so
friendly with their human brothers. Think,
the little chickadees, tame, gay, resourceful,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page83">[83]</a></span>
filling even the winter woods with their
song, the tiny wrens, the beautiful thrushes,
the squirrels and chipmunks, who need only
half an invitation and something on the table
to accept your offer of a nut cutlet, the rabbit
who lets you come within a few feet of him
while he still nibbles grass, and looks trustingly
at you out of his round prominent eyes,
the bear that thrusts his head out of the edge
of the woods, full of curiosity to see what
you are doing, the deer, even the little fawn,
who will become your playmate and take
sugar from your hand&mdash;all these trusting,
interested, friendly creatures are killed by
the hundreds of thousands in a forest fire.
The smoke stifles them, the loud reports of
the wood gases escaping from the burning
trees terrify them, and the light and heat
confuse them. It is difficult to find a single
good thing to say for a forest fire. It spells
devastation, loss, untold suffering, and in its
path there is only desolation. The merciful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page84">[84]</a></span>
fire-weed springs up after it, trying with its
summer flame to cover the black ravage,
the gutted ground, where the demon has
burned deep into the peaty subsoil. Everywhere
one sees what an awful fight for life
has taken place: thousands of little birds,
suffocated by the smoke, have dropped into
the flames, thousands of creatures, tortured
by the heat, have rushed into the fire instead
of away from it. Worse than the flood is
fire, because the suffering is so much the
greater. Somehow there is something utterly,
irredeemably tragic to any one who
has gone over these great fire-swept stretches
of land in our country; the thick stagnant
water that is left, the charred bones, and
the look of waste which shall never meet in
the space of a human life with repair.</p>

<p>No time to put out the camp fire? That
little fire will just go out of itself, will it?
Yes, probably, when it has accomplished
what I have described for you, when it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page85">[85]</a></span>
killed happy life, razed the beautiful trees,
gutted out the earth, and devoured, careless
of agony, all that it will have. Fire is the
dragon of our modern wilderness, and it will
be glutted and gorged, and not satisfied until
it is. That jolly little camp fire is worth
keeping an eye on, it is worth the trouble,
even if we have to go half a mile to fetch it,
to get a pail of water and ring the embers
around with the wet so that the fire cannot
spread. Never leave a camp fire burning;
no registered guide would do such a thing,
and no sportsman. It is only those who
don&#8217;t know or who are criminally careless
who would. If the public will not take responsibility
in this matter, the fire wardens
are helpless. Some enemies these men must
inevitably fight: the lightning which strikes a
dead, punky stump in the midst of dry
woods, which, smouldering a long while, finally
bursts into flame; the spark from an
engine; even spontaneous combustion due to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page86">[86]</a></span>
imprisoned gases acted upon by sun-heat.
But there is one enemy which the fire wardens
should not need to meet, and that is
man: the boy or girl camping, the man who
drops a cigar stump or match carelessly onto
dry leaves, the hunter who uses combustible
wadding in his shotgun. Let us help the fire
wardens, those men who live on lonely mountain
summits or in the midst of the wilderness
with eyes ever vigilant to detect the
starting of a fire&mdash;let us help, I say, these
fire wardens to get rid of one nuisance at
least, and let us keep our great, cool, wonderful
American forests as beautiful as they
have ever been and should always be for
those who are in a holiday humor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="fsize80">OTHER SMOKE</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">T</span><span class="startword0">here</span> will not be much opportunity
to dwell on all the wealth of
information that comes to the
real camper. The life of the woods is not
only a lively one, but one teeming with intelligences
and the kind of information which
one can get no place else. My years of
camping have stored my mind full of pictures
and full of memories about which I
could write indefinitely. In the practical activities
of camp life we mustn&#8217;t forget that
the silent wonderful life of the wilderness
is ours to study if we but bring keen eyes to
it, quick hearing and receptive minds.</p>

<p>Let me tell you of one experience which
I had some four years ago on the edge of a
solitary little pond in the forest wilderness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page88">[88]</a></span>
Our way lay over a narrow trail, now
through birches full of light, then through
maples, past spruce and other trees, down,
down, down toward the little pond which lay
like a jewel at the bottom of a hollow. It
was a favorite spot for beavers and we were
going to watch them work. Their rising
time is sundown, so we should be there before
they were up. It was growing quieter
and quieter in the ever-quiet woods, and when
we hid ourselves behind some bushes near
the edge of the pond on the opposite side
from the beaver houses, there was scarcely
a sound, and the drip of the water from a
heron&#8217;s wings as the bird mounted in flight,
seemed astonishingly loud.</p>

<p>Soon the beavers, unaware of us, came
out of their houses and began to work,
steadily and silently. We knew them for
what they were, builders of dams, of
bridges, of houses, mighty in battle so that
a single stroke from their broad flat tails<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page89">[89]</a></span>
kills a dog instantly, wood cutters, carriers
of mud and stone&mdash;animals endowed with
almost human intelligence and with an industry
greater than human. And I never
saw work done more quietly, efficiently and
silently than I did that night by the edge of
Beaver Pond.</p>

<p>As we sat there peering through the
bushes I thought instinctively of the silent
work which we do within ourselves or which
is done for us. Deep down within us so
much is going on of which &#8220;we,&#8221; as we
speak of the conscious outer self, are not
aware. Take, for example, the frequent
and common experience of forgetting a word
or a name. Despite the greatest effort we
cannot recall it, and finding ourselves helpless
we dismiss the matter from our minds
and go on to other things. Suddenly, without
any seeming effort on our part the word
has come to us. Now this reveals a great
truth about a great silent power: <i>all we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page90">[90]</a></span>
to do is to set the right forces to work and
frequently the work is done for us</i>. With
this serviceable power within us, why not
make use of it habitually? It renews itself
constantly and waits for us to call upon it
for protection, for comfort, for correction
and strength. It insists only that we think
as nearly rightly as we can. Beavers of silence
are busy within us.</p>

<p>Much of the work of this silent power is
done in our sleep-time. It is important,
therefore, that our last thoughts at night and
our first in the morning should be the best of
which we are capable. Prayer is a profound
acknowledgment of this power within us.
We have all heard the expression, &#8220;the night
brings counsel.&#8221; And probably most of us
have said, &#8220;Oh, well, we&#8217;ll just sleep on
that!&#8221; Why &#8220;sleep on it&#8221;? Because we
have confidence in this silent power whose
processes, whether we sleep or wake, are
constantly at work within us, even as night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page91">[91]</a></span>
and day, a natural power, directs the growth
of tree and flower. Again we have counted
upon the work of industrious beavers of silence&mdash;the
silent workers within each one of
us.</p>

<p>The woods are full of lessons never to be
learned any place else. Insensibly are we,
in this vast big intelligent life of the forest,
led on to meditate about the things we see.
I often wish not only that I could place myself
at certain times in those solitary places
by edge of pond, deep in forest, on the hillside,
following the trail, but also that I
might send a friend or two to the healing
which can be found in the wilderness. For
example, the girls who find nothing but
troubles and vexations in life, who groan if
the conversation languishes, are likely to
have some of their troubles slip away from
them and their talk become more cheerful.
Who can be in the woods, who can live in
the great out of doors and not feel optimistic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page92">[92]</a></span>
at least hopeful and interested? To
every girl inclined to be moody, often to
suffer from the conviction that living is difficult
and perhaps not worth while, I commend
camp life. Activity, distraction are its
powerful and wholesome remedies for melancholy.
In that life one is obliged to work
mind and body much as the beavers work,
one&#8217;s attention is held to something every
minute. The whole current of our thoughts
has been changed and for the time being we
are distracted from the old bruised ways of
thinking. The very alteration that comes
with wood life gives us a chance to think
rightly. Who can be troubled or bored or
bad tempered and follow the trail? Who
can be indifferent and be conscious of the
energy and intelligence of beaver and squirrel,
of rabbit and bird, of deer and moose?
Soon the whole misery-breeding brood of
cares, of doubts, of perplexities that existed
before we left our home drop away from us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page93">[93]</a></span>
We can use the influence of this vast sane
life of the wilderness for ourselves and by
its strength make good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="fsize80">FITTING UP THE CAMP FOR USE</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">A</span><span class="startword0">ny</span> girl who has crossed the ocean
knows how impossible, the first
time she entered her little white
cabin, that bit of space looked as a place
in which to sleep and to spend part of her
time. There seemed to be no room in it
for anything; it was difficult to turn
around in, there were so few hooks on which
to hang things, and the berth&mdash;dear me, that
berth! So her thoughts ran. Yet gradually,
as she learned the ropes, she was able to
make it homelike. With experience she
learned that the more bags she had in which
to put things, the easier it was to keep this
little stateroom in order. The next time she
took with her every conceivable sort of bag
for every conceivable sort of object. Also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page95">[95]</a></span>
she had learned that the more she could do
without unnecessary things in her cabin and
steamer trunk, the more comfort was hers
to enjoy. By the time she had crossed the
ocean often, she had learned the art of having
little but all that she needed with her&mdash;the
art of making herself comfortable in a
stateroom.</p>

<p>Even so is there an art in learning how to
camp, a happy art of which there is always
something left to learn. The oldest campers
never get beyond the point where they
can make a slight improvement in their kit
or their methods. In the end you will work
out your own salvation for the kind of camping
you wish to do. It is my intention to
point out to you only what might be called
the ground plan of fitting up a camp for use.
Those little individual adaptations which
every one of us makes, increasing familiarity
with camp life will help you to make for
yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>First, last, and always, when making out
your camp lists, revise them carefully with
the idea of cutting out everything unnecessary.
All besides what you actually need
will be clutter. The best way to do is to
make out your lists, putting down everything
that comes to you. Then go over them
by yourselves and a second time with some
one else. Your check lists for camp are important
and should always be conscientiously
made out, with nothing left to chance, nothing
done hit or miss.</p>

<p>If you are to furnish a camp, remember
that your packing boxes can do great work
in helping to set you up in your new home.
In rough camping such boxes do well for
dressers, washstands and, with a little carpentry,
also for clothes presses. A piece of
enameled cloth on the top of the one to be
used as a washstand, and a towel or white
curtain strung on a string in front of it, behind
which you can put dirty clothes, make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page97">[97]</a></span>
a thoroughly satisfactory article of furniture.
In camp there is no need to think
about elegance. Fitness and usefulness are
all the girl need ever consider. It is astonishing
how much beauty your homely cabin
and white tent will acquire&mdash;a beauty all
their own.</p>

<p>For tent camping the usual camp cot bed
is probably most satisfactory, for it is light
and readily carried. If you are on the march
and carrying at the most a tent fly for protection,
you will, of course, sleep on bough
beds or browse beds. Small, cut saplings,
well trimmed, make good springs for beds.
Any guide can help you to make the beds,
and you would better be about it early, for
it takes a good three-quarters of an hour to
make a comfortable bough bed. Perhaps a
few suggestions will not come amiss. You
will, of course, have both good hunting
knives, worn in a leather sheath on a leather
belt, and belt-sheath hatchets. With the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page98">[98]</a></span>
hatchet cut down a stout little balsam tree.
From this break the tips from the big
branches, having them about one foot in
length. These foot-length stems make
good bed springs and are the only bed
springs you will have on a balsam couch unless
you provide the spring yourself because
of some green worm who is industriously
measuring off the length of your nose, no
doubt in amazement that there should be
anything so extraordinarily long in the
world. However, he is a harmless little
chap, and the balsam tree having treated
him very kindly, he will be greatly surprised
at any other kind of entertainment which he
may receive from you. Now, having got your
&#8220;feathers,&#8221; select a smooth piece of ground
with a slight slope toward the foot. Press
the stems of the feathers into the earth, laying
them tier after tier as you have seen a
roof shingled, until your bed is wide enough,
long enough, and soft enough to give you a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page99">[99]</a><br /><a id="Page100">[100]</a></span>
good and sweet-scented night of sleep upon
it. Lay a fair-sized log along each side and
across the foot. This balsam bough bed can
be made up as often as you wish with fresh
feathers. Place one blanket on top and it is
ready for your use. If you have got pitch
on your hands in doing this, rub them with
a little butter or lard and it will come off.</p>

<p class="allclear">There is still an easier bed to make. A
bag of stout bed ticking, filled with leaves
and grass, forms an excellent mattress and
has the virtue of being portable, for the bag
can always be emptied, folded up, packed,
and refilled at the next camp ground. A thin
rubber blanket or poncho laid over this
makes it an absolutely dry bed at all times.
If you are to camp in a log cabin, probably
the most comfortable bed for you to plan is
a spring, bought at the nearest village, and
nailed onto log posts a foot and a half high.
With your ticking mattress filled with straw,
your day lived in the great out of doors, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page101">[101]</a></span>
one will need to wish you pleasant slumber.</p>

<p>It is well to have a good supply of tarlatan
on hand. This is finer than mosquito
netting and therefore more impervious to
stinging insects. If you camp in June, or
the first week or so in July, you are likely
in many parts of the country to find black
flies, mosquitoes, and midges to battle
against. There should be enough tarlatan
to use over the camp bed and also enough to
cover completely a hat with a brim and to
fall down about the neck, where it can be
tied under the collar. A more expensive
head-net of black silk Brussels net can be
made. This costs a good deal more, but
the great advantage of it is, that the black
does not alter the colors of the world out
upon which one looks. Don&#8217;t make any
mistake about the importance of some kind
of netting and fly dope, or &#8220;bug juice,&#8221; as
the antidotes for insect bites are sometimes
called. There are various kinds of fly dope,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page102">[102]</a></span>
any one of which is likely to prove useful.
There is an excellent recipe for the making
of your own fly dope in Breck&#8217;s &#8220;Way of the
Woods,&#8221; which I give here.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A tiny vial of
ammonia will also prove useful. One drop
on a bite will often stop further poisoning
from an insect sting. Inquiries should always
be made beforehand whether one is
likely to encounter black flies and midges.
Those who have met them once are not
likely to wish to have a second unprotected
meeting. They are the pests of the woods
and the wilderness.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>I will give, just as they occur to me, a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page103">[103]</a></span>
other articles which will be useful in the camp
life: a small cake of camphor to break over
things in the knapsack and keep off crawlers;
a small emergency box containing surgeon&#8217;s
plaster and the usual things; vaseline,
witch hazel; jack knife; tool kit; a map of
the region in which you are camping and a
diary in which to take notes. To these might
be added sewing articles, a sleeping bag if
you care to use one, and a folding brown
duck waterpail. The catalog from any
sporting goods place will suggest a thousand
other articles which you may care to have.</p>

<p>With a few planks to saw up into lengths,
and a few white birch saplings, a most attractive
camp dinner table can be made.
Over this a piece of white oilcloth should
be laid and kept clean by the use of a little
sapolio. It is best not to buy an expensive
stove for the cabin. A second-hand kitchen
range, which can be purchased for a few
dollars, will do quite well for the cooking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page104">[104]</a></span>
cabin or shack, and an open Franklin stove
for the living cabin. If one is going to camp
in tents and wants a stove in one of them,
it will be necessary to buy a regular tent
stove. Anything else would not be safe.</p>

<p>As far as actual furniture is concerned,
except for camp stools or benches and camp
chairs, if you wish to be very elegant, the
camp is now furnished. But there are still
to be considered the necessary utensils for
cooking and other purposes. I will enumerate
them again just as they occur to me,
and not necessarily in the order of their importance:
kerosene oil can, molasses jug,
pails, a tin baker, a teapot, tin and earthen
dishes, tin and earthen cups, basins for
washing, pans for baking and for milk, dishpans,
dishmop, double boiler, broiler, knives,
forks, teaspoons, tablespoons, mixing spoons,
pepper box, salt shaker, nutmeg grater, flour
sifter, can opener, frying pans&mdash;one with a
long handle for use in cooking over open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page105">[105]</a></span>
fires&mdash;butcher knife, bread knife, lantern,
bucket, egg beater, potato masher, rolling
pin, axe, hatchet, nails, hammer, toilet paper,
woolen blankets, rubber blankets, crash for
dish towels, yellow soap, some wire, twine,
tacks, and a small fireless cooker if you know
how to use one. A good fireless cooker can
be built on the premises.</p>

<p>Possessed of these articles, any one who
knows anything about the woods can be most
comfortable. They can, of course, be added
to indefinitely. One may make camp life as
expensive and complicated as one pleases.
But to do that seems a pity, for it is against
the very good and spirit of the wilderness
life. The wood life and all its new and invigorating
experience should take us back to
nature. It is for that we go into the wilderness
and not to bring with us the luxuries of
civilization. Part of the wholesomeness of
camp life lies in learning to do without, in
the fine simplicity which we are obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page106">[106]</a></span>
practice there. Common sense is the law of
the wilderness life, and let us be sure that
we follow that law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE POCKETBOOK</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">O</span><span class="startword0">ne</span> of the objects of some girls
on their camping expeditions is
to keep the trip from becoming
too expensive. The maximum of value
must be got from the minimum of pence.
And I think that is as it should be, for,
with economy, the life is kept nearer a
simple ideal, is made more active and more
wholesome. All sorts and conditions of
camping have been my lot, the five-dollar-a-day
camping in a log cabin (?) equipped
with running water and a porcelain tub, and
the kind of camping one does under a fly
with the rain and sunshine and wind driving
in at their pleasure. Although I do not advise
the latter as far as health results are
concerned, given that the party is in fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page108">[108]</a></span>
condition they will be none the worse for the
experiment.</p>

<p>Camping for a party of four or five should
usually cost something between eight dollars
and eighteen dollars apiece per week. This
rate includes a guide and a good deal of
service, a rowboat, a canoe, and no care
about food. But the longer I camp the more
I am of the opinion that the simpler and
more independent the life is, the greater
health and pleasure it will bring. It has

much health, much good fellowship and good
temper, much enjoyment of beauty&mdash;and all
for little money and, rightly judged, for no

<p class="allclear">The girl who is the right sort gets more
fun out of camp life when she does at least
part of the work herself. Let her economize
and use her own ingenuity and do the work.
Any group of three or four girls can provide
all the necessary &#8220;grub&#8221; for themselves at
$3<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page109">[109]</a><br /><a id="Page110">[110]</a></span>
a week per capita. This sum does not include
rental or purchase of tent. A good
tent, 7 &times; 7, big enough for two at a pinch,
can be bought complete (this does not include
fly) for about $7. You can get tents second-hand
often for a song, or as a loan, or you
can rent your tent for 10 cents a day. Get
at least a few numbers of one or several of
the following sporting magazines: <i>Outing</i>,
<i>Country Life in America</i>, <i>Forest and Stream</i>,
<i>Field and Stream</i>, <i>Recreation</i>, <i>Rod and Gun
in Canada</i>. Look in the advertisement pages
of these magazines for the names of sporting
goods houses and send for catalogs. Then
choose your style of tent. The different kinds
of tents are legion. The Kenyon Take-Down
House, too, is a capital camp home.
It is &#8220;skeet&#8221;-proof and fly-proof. Send to
Michigan for a catalog, and then go like
the classic turtle with your shell on your back.
In groups of four or more, the $10 laid by
for a vacation should bring two holiday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page111">[111]</a></span>
weeks&mdash;possibly a day or so over; $15, three
weeks and a bit over, and $20 a whole glorious
month. Expensive camping may be the
&#8220;style&#8221; in certain localities, but it is not necessarily
the &#8220;fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>For eight weeks this past summer my
family of two members camped with two
servants. In addition we had the occasional
services of a man who did all the heavy
work. There was not enough for the servants
to do in the cottage and log cabin of
our establishment. They were discontented,
faultfinding, and wholly out of the spirit of
camp life. All of the day that their tone of
voice reached was helplessly ruined. The
only way to keep the camp joy and pleasure
was to keep out of their way. On our camp
table we had silver, embroidered linen
cloths, the same food, in almost the same
variety, that we had it at home, and the
same amount of service. All I can say is
that it was a perfect nuisance&mdash;as perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page112">[112]</a></span>
planned and executed a nuisance as one could
well conceive. Everywhere these servants
looked they found things which did not suit
them. What I think they wished was a modest
twenty-thousand-dollar cottage in that
great and wonderful wilderness.</p>

<p>In the autumn I camped alone for two
weeks in a log cabin. I say alone. I was not
alone, for I had three friends with me&mdash;a
collie puppy, a blind fawn, and a year-old
cat. They were the best of companions&mdash;for
better I could not have asked. I never
heard a word of faultfinding, and I was witness
to a great deal of joy. It is a curious
fact about camp life that if a girl has weak
places in her character, if she is selfish or
peevish or faultfinding or untidy, these
weaknesses will all come out. But my four-footed
friends were good nature itself,
young, growing, happy, contented. And
they had excellent appetites. I tell you this
because I want you to see how much of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page113">[113]</a><br /><a id="Page114">[114]</a></span>
item their food was in the expenses I shall
enumerate. This might be called a little intimate
history of at least one camp pocketbook.
The fawn had a quart of milk a day
and much lettuce, together with the kind of
food which deer live upon: leaves, grass,
clover, ferns. I had to pay for her bedding
of hay. The puppy and the cat shared another
quart of milk between them. The cat
hunted by night, but the puppy was fed entirely
by hand on bread, milk, an occasional
egg, cereals, and vegetables. My own fare
consisted of all the bread and butter I
wished, cocoa, condensed milk, bananas, apples,
eggs, potatoes, beans, nuts, raisins,
cauliflower, chocolate, and a few other articles.
And there was, too, the denatured
alcohol to be paid for&mdash;a heavy item, for I
used only a chafing dish and a small spirit
lamp. The milk was eight cents a quart on
account of the carriage, the butter was
thirty-eight cents a pound, the eggs twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page115">[115]</a></span>
cents a dozen. Except for cutting up
and splitting the wood for my open Franklin
stove, the wood cost me nothing. But I
paid a man a dollar for half a day&#8217;s work.
We weren&#8217;t seven, but we were four in that
camp community. How much do you think
the food for all averaged per week in those
two weeks? Three dollars a week, and we
had all that we wanted and more, too.</p>

<p>When girls plan carefully and intelligently,
when they exercise good sense in the
cooking and care of food, there is no reason
why, with a party of four or five girls, from
three dollars to four dollars apiece per week
should not cover all living, exclusive, of
course, of the traveling expenses. And the
camping can be done for less. I commend
these expense items to all Vacation Bureaus
and to Camp Fire Girls.</p>

<p>In the two weeks I camped alone I was
very busy with my writing. To this I was
obliged to give most of the daylight. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page116">[116]</a></span>
this, I had much business correspondence
to attend to. It takes time to care properly
for animals, and my pets had not only
to be fed, but also to be brushed and generally
cared for. I planned to spend some
time every day with the blind fawn so that
I might amuse her. I did all these things,
took care of my little cabin, had time for a
walk every afternoon, and went to bed when
the birds did, to get up the next morning at
five o&#8217;clock. Had I been able to give my
thought entirely to the food question, I am
certain that the expense of these items might
have been made even less.</p>

<p>Some girls will think this is getting back
to the simple life with a vengeance. So it was
but I can assure you that those two weeks
were most happy and profitable in every
way&mdash;far better than the over-served, over-fed
months which had preceded them. For
any girl who needs to forget how superficial
to the real needs of life the luxuries are;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page117">[117]</a></span>
for any girl who is lazy in household ways;
for any girl who needs character building;
for any girl who is in need of deep breathing
and the pines; for any girl who wants
more active life than she gets in her own
home; for any girl who is of an experimental
or adventurous turn of mind; for
any girl who needs to be drawn away from
her books; for any girl who wants to form
new friendships in a big, sane, and beautiful
world where the greetings are all friendly;
for any girl&mdash;for every girl&mdash;who wants
much for little; the log cabin, the tent, the
shack in the wilderness, by pond or lake,
upon the hillsides or in the valleys, will
prove a &#8220;joy forever.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE CAMP DOG</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">W</span><span class="startword0">hen</span> I began to go into the wilderness
to camp, I was much
more credulous than I am now.
Everywhere I went in the woods I saw an
implement which looked like a cross between
a pickaxe with a long handle and the largest
pair of tweezers ever seen. This was always
lying up against something as if just
ready for use, much as one sees an axe resting
against a cabin wall or on a chopping
block. I couldn&#8217;t make out what this could
be used for. Finally, curiosity getting the
better of me and no opportunity for seeing
it used offering itself, I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that,&#8221; answered the guide with a
twinkle in his eye, &#8220;that is the camp dog.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;How nice!&#8221; I thought. &#8220;Why is it
called camp dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see it does most of the work
for us and being so faithful and handy
we&#8217;ve just got naturally into the way of calling
it a camp dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was still more impressed when he gave
me then and there several illustrations of
its usefulness. But the end of the tale of
the camp dog is not yet,&mdash;in fact it was a
very long tale for me, the end of which you
shall have in good season.</p>

<p>Generally speaking it may be said that it
is the guide and not this implement which is
the camp dog. It is he who is faithful, always
handy, always willing. And it is he
who is more imposed upon than any other
member of the camp community. The guide
is a responsible person,&mdash;<i>the</i> responsible
person. He is usually registered and his
pay is always good. He needs every dollar
he gets and every bit of authority, too, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page120">[120]</a></span>
he works hard and often for groups of
people who are thorough in only one respect
and that is in their irresponsibility.
The guide has to be sure that fires are kindled
in the right places and that they are
really out when they should be; he must
keep his party from foolhardy acts of any
kind; he must be sure that they have a good
time and certain that they are not overtaxed;
if it comes off cold or is cold, he must keep
them warm; he must see, despite every vicissitude,
that they are enjoying themselves; he
must do the cooking&mdash;and he must be a
good cook,&mdash;boil the coffee, wash the
dishes, pitch and strike the tents; he must
pilot the members of the party to the best
places for fishing, often bait their hooks or
teach them how to bait, dig their worms;
and give their first lessons in casting a fly;
must instruct them in all necessary wood
craft and keep them from shooting wildly;
he must see that the game laws of the state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page121">[121]</a></span>
are observed, also the fire laws; if anything
should happen to a member of his party,
he will, in all likelihood, be held responsible
for it; and finally, always and all the time,
no matter how he himself feels, he must be
agreeable, obliging, useful.</p>

<p>Now if the man who has all these burdens
to bear is not a camp dog, I should
like to know what he is? To those of us
who have been into the woods year after
year, it is a sort of boundless irritation to
see some members of the camping party
sitting about idle while the guide does the
work. Part of the value of camp life is its
activity, its activities. Another part of its
good is the skill which comes from learning
to be useful in the woods. The life out-of-doors
should be a constant training in
manual work,&mdash;call it wood work if you
wish. I am reminded of a story told in
&#8220;Vanity Fair&#8221; about a lazy, indifferent student
who was in the class of a famous physicist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page122">[122]</a></span>
The freshman sprawled in the rear
seat and was sleeping or was about to go
to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fraser,&#8221; said the physicist sharply,
&#8220;you may recite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fraser opened his eyes but he did not
change his somnolent pose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fraser, what is work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, everything is work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I take it you would like the class
to believe that this desk is work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; wearily, &#8220;wood work.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the moment that school of the
woods is entered every girl has her wood
work cut out for her, if she is taking camping
in the right spirit. It is all team play
in the wilderness, or if it is not, it is a rather
poor game. Helpfulness is one of the first
rules and every camper should be willing
to help the guide. Usually the guides are a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page123">[123]</a></span>
fine set of self respecting, dignified, resourceful
men. And I think it might be said with
considerable truthfulness that when they are
not what they ought to be, it is nine times
out of ten due to the undesirable influence
of the parties they have worked for. Your
guide is your equal in most respects and
your superior in others. He should be met
on a footing of equality. I use this word
advisedly and I do <i>not</i> mean familiarity.
Well-bred girls do not meet anyone, whether
in the wilderness or in civilization, on
this footing immediately. The party should
be willing and glad to help the guide in
every possible way. That does not signify
doing his work for him but it does indicate
helping him.</p>

<p>A routine of some sort should be adopted
and is one of the best ways to assist him.
One girl should be on duty at one time and
another at another and all in regular rotation.
No camp life can go on successfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page124">[124]</a></span>
without some law and order of this sort. For
it is just as necessary for the smooth running
of household wheels in the log cabin as it
is in the city home. Whoever occupies the
guide&#8217;s position, that is the one who is chiefly
responsible for everything, should be ably
helped by the whole party but not by the
whole party at the same time. Evolve a
system for the particular conditions of the
camp life in which you find yourself and
stick to it. Let one girl or one set of girls
help one day and another the next. Let the
girl be detailed to do one kind of work one
day and another another. This system,
with proper rotation, means that nobody
gets tired of her work. A girl cannot be
too self-reliant if she is ever to be wise in
the way of the woods. There is no need
for discouragement if everything is not
learned at once, for camping is like skating
and is an art to be learned only through
many tumbles and mistakes. Be prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page125">[125]</a></span>
to take it and yourself lightly&mdash;in short, to
laugh readily over the mistakes made in the
art of living in the woods.</p>

<p>Now we have come to the very tip of the
tail of the camp dog. You will be interested
to know how an old timer was obliged to
laugh at herself. I am ashamed to tell you
how recently this occurred. I was in the
northernmost wilderness of the state of
Maine, and near a big lumber camp, when
I saw a &#8220;camp dog&#8221; lying on the ground,
its long axe handle shining from use, its
pickaxe blade a bright steel color, and the
tooth at the back looking as if it had been
often used. I was delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I said to my guide, &#8220;look at that
camp dog lying there!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was particularly attentive to my pronunciation,
for he said I pronounced some
words, such as &#8220;girl,&#8221; as he had never heard
them pronounced before. I saw a curious
expression pass across his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say that was?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that camp dog lying there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Camp dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he began to laugh and he kept right
on until the woods echoed with his roars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said finally, wiping away the
tears, &#8220;if that doesn&#8217;t beat everything! That
isn&#8217;t a camp dog, that&#8217;s a cant dog,&mdash;you
know what you cant logs and heavy things
over with, roll &#8217;em over and pry &#8217;em up with
when you couldn&#8217;t do it any other way. My
grief, to think of your calling that a camp
dog all these years!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he went off into another guffaw.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE OUTDOOR TRAINING SCHOOL</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">M</span><span class="startword0">any</span> girls think of outdoor life
as of something to be enjoyed
if they have plenty of time. As
a matter of course they take their daily
bath. But the outdoor exercise comes as
an accessory. It is still unfortunately true
that boys more than girls take camp life
for granted. Yet girls, and students particularly,
should realize that it is economy of
time to be out of doors. This they need
both for their work and for their health.
Outdoor exercise, with its bath of fresh air
and the natural bath of freshly circulating
blood it brings with it, its training school
for the whole girl, is as essential as the tub
or sponge bath. But how many of us think
of it in that way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>To be outdoors is to have the nerves
keyed to the proper pitch. If fresh air is
not a tonic to the nerves, then why is it
that moodiness and depression fall away as
we walk or row or lie under the trees, and
we become saner and more serene? When
one is depressed the best thing to do is to
go out of doors. Altogether aside from
any formal wisdom of book or student or
teacher, there is wisdom with nature. <i>If
the head is tired, go out of doors! If the
body is fagged, go out of doors! If the
heart is troubled, go out of doors!</i> The life
out there, as no life indoors can, will make
for health, for charity, for bigness. Petty
things fall away, and with nature equanimity
and poise are found again. It isn&#8217;t necessary
to bother someone about woes real or
imaginary. All that is necessary is to get out
among the trees and flowers, the sky and
clouds, the joyous birds and little creatures
of field and wood, and hear what they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page129">[129]</a></span>
to say. There will be no complaining
among them, even about very real difficulties.</p>

<p>A great deal is heard concerning hygiene
in these days, the study of it, the practice of
it. The biggest university of hygiene in the
world is not within houses but outside, up
that hillside where the trees are blowing, in
the doorway of our tent, on the lawn in
front of the house, out on the lake, even on
a city house-top, and, last resort if necessary,
by an open window. One reason why many
people are concerned about this question of
hygiene is because they know that not only
are human beings happier when they are
well and strong, but also because a healthy
person is, nine times out of ten, more moral
than one who is sick or sickly. Ill health
means offense of some kind, often one&#8217;s own,
against the laws of nature or society. We
have, too, to pay for one another&#8217;s faults.
But life lived on sound physical principles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page130">[130]</a></span>
with plenty of sunshine, cold water, exercise,
wind, rain, simple food and sensible clothing,
is not likely to be sickly, useless or burdensome.</p>

<p>The body is not a mechanism to be disregarded,
but an exquisitely made machine to
be exquisitely cared for. Nobody would
trust an engineer to run an engine he knows
nothing about. Yet most of us are running
our engines without any knowledge of the
machinery. Why should we excuse ourselves
for lack of knowledge and care when, for
the same reasons a chauffeur, for example,
would be immediately dismissed? How
many of us know that the nerves are more
or less dependent upon the muscles for their
tone? How many of us realize how important
it is to keep in perfect muscular
condition? We sit hour after hour in our
chairs, all our muscles relaxed, bending over
books, and begrudge one hour&mdash;it ought to
be three or four!&mdash;out of doors. The person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page131">[131]</a><br /><a id="Page132">[132]</a></span>
who can run furthest and swiftest is the
one with the strongest heart. The person

health.<span class="nowrap">... <i>It</i></span> <i>may be laid down as an absolute

better work when he is well than when he is
not in good physical condition.</i> Ceaseless activity
is the law of nature and the body that
is resolutely active does not grow old as
rapidly as the one that is physically indolent.</p>

<p>Much out-of-door life, much camping,
keep one young in heart, too. It isn&#8217;t possible
to grow old or sophisticated among
such a wealth of joyous, wholesome friendships
as may be found in nature, where no
unclean word is ever heard and where no
unfriendliness, no false pride, no jealousy
can exist. A great English poet, William
Wordsworth, has told us more of the shaping
power of nature, its quickening spirit,
its power of restoration, than any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page133">[133]</a></span>
poet. It would be well for every girl to take
that wonderful poem &#8220;Tintern Abbey&#8221; out
of doors and read it there. Wordsworth,
still a very young man when he wrote it,
tells how he loved the Welsh landscape and
the tranquil restoration it had brought him</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>A higher gift he acknowledges, too, when
through the harmony and joy of nature he
had been led to see deeply &#8220;into the life of
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is something the matter with a girl
who hasn&#8217;t an appetite, as sharp as hunger,
to escape from her books and camp out of
doors. If outdoor life cannot engross her
wholly at times, banishing all thoughts of
work, then she should make an effort to
forget books and everything connected with
them for a while. A young girl ought to be
skillful in all sorts of outdoor accomplishments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page134">[134]</a></span>
rowing, swimming, riding and driving
if possible, canoeing, skating, sailing a
boat, fishing, hunting, mountain climbing.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is more of the play-spirit
connected with outdoor life than there
used to be. Both school and college have
fostered this wholesome attitude. If a girl
doesn&#8217;t like active sports she should cultivate
a love for them. You can always trust
a person who is accomplished in physical
ways, for anyone who has led an intelligent
out-of-door life is more self-reliant. Her
faculty for doing things, her inventiveness,
her poise, her &#8220;nerve&#8221; are all strengthened.
I recall an instance of this &#8220;faculty&#8221; and inventiveness.
We were on a wild Maine lake
when an accident happened to the canoe, a
necessity to our return, for we were far
away from all sources of help. Apparently
there was nothing with which to mend it.
But our Indian guide found there everything
he needed ready for his use. He scraped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page135">[135]</a><br /><a id="Page136">[136]</a></span>
gum off a tree, he cut a piece of bark, and
then he rummaged about until he discovered
an old wire. With these things he securely
mended a big hole. Oftentimes it seems as
if the very appliances with which city children
are provided tend to make them incapable.</p>

<p>The girl who lives out of doors acquires
unlimited resourcefulness. Outdoor life
quickens and sharpens the perception. And
for the girl to have her power of observation
sharpened is worth a great deal. The
capacity for accurate and quick observation
education from books does not always develop.
One must go back to nature for
that, one must live out in the woods and
fields all one can, one must be able
to tell the scent of honeysuckle from
the scent of the rose, and know the
fragrance of milkweed even before that
homely weed is seen, and know spruce, balsam
and white pine even as one knows a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page137">[137]</a><br /><a id="Page138">[138]</a></span>
friend. Eyes must be able to detect the differences
not only in colors and shapes of
birds, but in their flight, and ears know
every song of wood and field. Then the
services of beauty, its music, its color, its
form, will be always about us and nature&#8217;s
health and strength and beauty become our
own, not only her gaiety and &#8220;vital feelings
of delight,&#8221; but also her restraint upon
weakness, and her kindling to the highest
life&mdash;the life that is spiritual.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE CAMP HABIT</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">I</span><span class="startword0">f</span> there were no such thing as habit,
life would be nothing but a perpetual
beginning and recommencing over
and over again. All that we do or think
marks us with its imprint, leaving behind it a
tendency&mdash;a tendency towards repetition is
the beginning of habit, and because of it we
can get the camp habit just as we can get any
other habit. The instinct to repeat our
camping out of doors gradually grows
stronger. At last, scarcely conscious of the
existence of the demand, we have come to
feel that we cannot pass our holiday in any
other way. The first camping experience
stands out in bold relief because it is new.
As we live into it, its first impressions are
lost. And it is at this moment, if we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page140">[140]</a></span>
made of the right stuff and have in us the
right longings and needs, that we begin to
have the camp habit.</p>

<p>Just as with people, maybe we scarcely
realize how much it means to us. But let
us stop to think about it, let us give this
good camp habit a full opportunity if we can
in our lives. Already the camp habit has
become a need, almost an imperious demand.
We feel that once in so often it must
be satisfied and in the splendid grip of this
good habit we make way for it. Never let
us become dull to any of its values. Never
let us forget, however shot with black and
white it may be, even gray at times, the difficulties
of camping may make life seem&mdash;never
let us forget the treasures that it pours
in upon us and the ways in which the camp
habit serves us.</p>

<p>It is a sad and a great truth which perhaps
women and girls have not yet fully
realized, that the whole manner of our body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page141">[141]</a></span>
of our souls is controlled by the goodness, or
the badness of our habits, our moral character,
our physical temperament. There is
a sort of natural medicine, raising what is
not good inevitably up to what is better.
That is what the camp habit does for us,
raising what is not healthy, not strong, not
sane, not joyous, not self-reliant up to what
is strong, healthy, joyous and full of self-control.
Is not this alone sufficient reason
for giving the camp habit once in so
often full sway in our lives? What better
could we do than, in order to re-establish
ourselves, to claim again the wise big relationships
of out-of-doors and a thousand
and one little and big friends whom we can
find there?</p>

<p>Bad habits are thieves, for they take away
our energies, our abilities, our joys. And the
indoor habit is a thief. It shortens life, it
takes away from health, it saps energies, it
dilutes joys, it makes foggy heads and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page142">[142]</a></span>
punky morals. The sane girl will get out
of doors every opportunity instead of spending
her time in a hot room, playing cards,
or eating stuff that is not fit to put into the
human stomach or flirting with boys, who if
they are the right sort of boys, would much
prefer, too, to be out of doors. Good habits,
like this camp habit are benefactors,
great philanthropists; they strengthen us
and they give us more energy. They increase
our ability, they multiply our joys
compound interest-wise. Good habits are
careful accountants and every day or every
year as it may be, they put the interest of
strength, of intelligence, of joy, in our hands
to be used as we think best. The camp habit
wisely used, obliges us to open our eyes and
see life more truly. It obliges us to lift our
own weight, take our part in things, that part
may be washing dishes or it may be turning
griddle cakes,&mdash;it forces us to know ourselves
better and it gives us more power to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page143">[143]</a></span>
control ourselves. The camp habit&mdash;get it
quickly if you haven&#8217;t it already&mdash;assures us
of good health and success where, for example,
the indoor habit has brought us nothing
but ill health and failure. It is a habit
worth while getting, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>A good many of us know ourselves, such
as we are, pretty well and we feel that we
do not want to know ourselves any better.
Things are bad enough as they are. Yet if
we can&#8217;t have a more intimate knowledge of
ourselves, if we don&#8217;t arrange our lives better,
if we don&#8217;t plan for the future more
carefully, what are our lives likely to be like
when the curtain goes down? How are we
ever going to take the proverbial ounce of
prevention if we are not certain to a fraction
what it is we must prevent? Camp is
a splendid opportunity to think a little about
those things of which we have been afraid
to think. It is a good opportunity to meditate,
a friendly world to which to go to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page144">[144]</a></span>
know ourselves better. It is an old saying
that the first step towards the recovery of
health is to know yourself ill. In that great
out-of-door world which our American camp
life represents it is easier to find ourselves
morally than it is indoors, we get more
help for one thing. It is almost an instinct
in great trouble or bewilderment or difficulty
to escape into the out-of-door world, to get
back to earth and to ask from the great
mother those counsels we hear dimly or indifferently
indoors.</p>

<p>Wisdom will not be found in one camp
holiday or in fifty or in a lifetime even. But
it is rather strange, isn&#8217;t it, that the person
whom we know least is so frequently ourselves?
We know very well that the most
learned man or woman is not the one whose
head is stuffed with information, is not necessarily
the conspicuous or famous man or
woman, but is, rather, the human being who
knows himself. And this human being may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page145">[145]</a></span>
be not our teacher, but our janitor or a
nurse who takes care of the baby or that
fellow who seems so simple, the guide who
has our camping trip in charge. Indeed,
there is scarcely a class of men who seem
in better control of themselves and who have
a better working knowledge of themselves
and others than the highest type of guide.
All the associations of that great out-of-door
life, its demands, its privations, its sudden
needs, its great silence, its dumb creatures,
its wonderful beauty, have taught the man of
the woods a wisdom no school, no university,
can offer merely through its curriculum. We
can&#8217;t realize too early how well worth while
that wisdom is for every girl to have. Not
a thing of book learning, but a power that
makes one truthful with oneself, eager to
acknowledge what is bad and to change it.
Frank, courageous, tried in commonplace
wisdom, and with a knowledge of other human
beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one kind of idea&mdash;and it is worth
while meditating in the woods on the leverage
power of even one very little idea&mdash;that
can always be found out of doors. I mean
a healthful idea, the kind of thought that
makes us stand straighter, that strengthens
the muscles of our backbone, that makes us
act as if we were what we wish to be. There
is no other force in the world that can so
readily straighten out a crooked boy or
a crooked girl as this same Dr. Dame Nature.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page147">[147]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="fsize80">OTHER CLEANLINESS</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">C</span><span class="startword0">lean?</span> Of course, we all know
what cleanliness means. It is
not possible to drive, to ride in
a trolley, to go on a train without
being impressed with at least the advertising
energy that is put into trying to get or
keep the world clean. Dear me, there are
the ever-present, cheerful Gold Dust Twins,
well up with the times, you may believe,
and nowadays taking to aviation. Their
aeroplanes may not be very large, but
they are clean as gold dust can make them,
and the twins, without any of the friction
that comes from dirt, are flying at last.
What&#8217;s more, intrepid as some old Forty-Niner,
they are penetrating the camper&#8217;s
wilderness. Most of us do not want to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page148">[148]</a></span>
twins, and we certainly do not want to be
gold dusters or any other kind of dusters,
yet we should miss these jolly little youngsters.
And there are Sapolio and Sunny
Monday advertisements and Pears&#8217; soap&mdash;have
you used it?&mdash;and a dozen other kinds
and goodness knows what not besides.</p>

<p>Yes, we Americans, and especially American
women in the household, know what it
is to make an effort in the midst of heated,
dusty or uncared for streets to keep our
houses and everything in them clean. In
Pennsylvania you see the people scrubbing
off white marble steps. In New England
they turn the hose on the outside of their
white farm houses. In the West they flood
the side-walks to keep the dust and heat
down. And our houses? Well, all houses
are being built with bath tubs nowadays,
even our camps, which is more than can be
said for very good houses indeed in other
countries than America. Some people think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page149">[149]</a></span>
that camping is an excuse to be dirty. Often
they are very nice people, too, but they keep
a dirty camp. They don&#8217;t keep even themselves
clean.</p>

<p>But there is another kind of cleanliness,
not superficial, not that of the skin, or of the
clothes or of the cabin, about which we are
coming to think more and more deeply. It
is what might be called vital cleanliness, the
cleanness of stomachs, of the intestines, of
all the vital organs. We begin to realize
the truth of what those most helpful of missionaries,
the health culturists, are saying:
One may be clean superficially, that is one
may scrub enough and yet vitally be very
far from clean. We know, although it is of
the greatest assistance to keep the skin free
and vigorous so that it is able to do its part
of the house-cleaning work for our systems,
that vital cleanliness, clean, strong, internal
organs performing their work with
the vigor of well-constructed engines, uninjured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page150">[150]</a></span>
by foolish clothing, unharmed by impure
food, keen for opportunity to grow
and be vigorous&mdash;we know, I say that that
cleanliness is more important than skin cleanliness.
Indeed, without such deep-seated
cleanliness it is impossible for the skin to be
really clean.</p>

<p>But clean how? I wonder whether we
are clean in the way I mean. Yes, we
are clean in our houses, perhaps in our
camps, clean on the outsides of our bodies,
clean probably, on the inside. Yet no one
of these kinds of cleanliness is what I have
in mind. Can any girl by the camp fire
guess what it is? I will not say it is more
important than household cleanliness, although
it is so,&mdash;vastly more so. I will not
say that it is more important than bodily
cleanliness, external and internal, yet it is so,&mdash;vastly
more so. I could almost say that
it is more important than anything else in
the world of human experience. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page151">[151]</a></span>
know what it is now? <i>It is cleanness of the
mind, cleanness of the soul</i>, and of that kind
of purity the great outdoor world is one indivisible
whole.</p>

<p>On this cleanliness of mind and soul all
the vital activities of the day depend, all the
growth, the gain, the development. It might
be well said that the way we take up the
sun into our bodies&mdash;and we could not live
any length of time without some sun&mdash;depends
upon the cleanness or uncleanness of
this mind and soul of ours. What we shall
eat, what we shall hear, what we shall see,
what we shall look forward to, what we
shall care for&mdash;all these things will be according
to laws as inevitable as those governing
the sun and moon and stars, valuable
or worthless, vicious or sacred, as we feel
them and we make them. We dip our fingers
in pitch and pick up a book. What is
the result? Any child could tell us that we
ruin the book with our pitch-covered fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page152">[152]</a></span>
We dip our minds into filth, a nasty
story, a perverted way of looking at things
which in themselves are good and of God&#8217;s
plan, or we actually commit some ugly act
ourselves and then we go out into the presence
of those things which are clean, the
sunshine, the hills, the lakes, the woods, the
white lives of others, the ideals which, it
may be, have been ours. Do you suppose
we feel or see that sunshine, or that we are
aware any longer of the white lives of
others, that our past ideals are evident to
us when our hearts and minds are no longer
clean? Do you suppose that there is anything
in nature which comes home to us in
quite the beautiful way it once did, the
flowers, the birds, the song of the wind, the
little creatures of the wood? Can they ever
be entirely the same? No, by an inevitable
law of compensations some of the fullness
of our joy in these things is gone. If we
want to be really happy it does not pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page153">[153]</a></span>
to think evil, to touch evil or to commit
it.</p>

<p>When our hands are dirty we know it,
and if we have been careless about them we
are ashamed. If people&#8217;s bodies or camps
are not clean it is painfully easy to know
that, too. But a dirty mind, who could ever
tell anyway that we had one? Who could
ever tell? I will tell you: <i>Every one knows
it</i>, or perhaps, better, every one feels it. If
we are not good, if our minds are not clean,
our presence in some mysterious way proclaims
that fact. If we have injured some
one, if we have been foul-tongued, others
will know it with no need for any one to
tell them. Even the little rabbit we meet in
the woods will not greet us in so friendly a
way. <i>We need not think that because we
are concealing a bad thought that it is therefore
hidden.</i> No, indeed, it is screaming
away like some ugly black crow on a spruce
tip, and there is no one within hearing distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page154">[154]</a></span>
who, whether he wishes to or not,
does not hear what it says.</p>

<p>The mind has its plague spots even as the
body, and one has to work&mdash;because of
one&#8217;s environment or some inheritance which
has made us not quite wholesome by nature,
or because of friends whose feelings
one would not injure, and yet who are not
what they ought to be,&mdash;one has often to
work to keep the mind clean. But as you
would flee from the plague, run from a dirty
story. Don&#8217;t let the camp life be spoiled
by anything to be regretted! Do not let
any one touch you with it, even with a word
of it. Keep a thousand miles away if you
can from folk who have an impure way of
looking at life, and camp is a good place to
get away from such people. Shut your
minds against them. One is never called
upon on the score of duty to have an unclean
mind because others have it. And if through
some misfortune, something that is unlovely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page155">[155]</a></span>
unclean, has been impressed upon you, fight
valiantly not to think of it, to put it away
from you. And never forget that to rule
our spirits, to be in command of our minds,
to have them wholesome and sweet and
clean as a freshly swept log cabin, is greater
than to win such victories as have come down
in the records of history.</p>

<p>I remember that when I was a child, I
thought my heart was white and that every
time I said or thought anything naughty, I
got a black spot on its surface. I dare say
that in the first place some dear old negro
woman put this fable into my mind. And,
dear me, some days it seemed to me that
heart of mine was more spotted than any
tiger lily that ever grew in any neglected
garden. Perhaps it was foolish to think such
a thing. I do not know, I only know that
there were times when I was mighty careful
of that white heart of mine,&mdash;wrapping it
up in a pocket handkerchief would not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page156">[156]</a></span>
satisfied my eagerness to keep it clean. And
what better could one wish than to go on
one&#8217;s holiday, and on forever, with the white
shining heart of a child?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="fsize80">WOOD CULTURE AND CAMP HEALTH</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">I</span><span class="startword0">t</span> is far better for the girl to be out in a
wilderness world which demands all
the attention of both heart and mind,
than to be leading an idle or sedentary life
at home. If there is one word which above
all others expresses the life of the woods, it
is the word <span class="smcapall">WHOLESOME</span>. It is a normal,
active, &#8220;hard-pan&#8221; life which takes the softness
not only out of the muscles, but also
out of the thoughts and the feelings. It
tightens up the tendons of our bodies and
the even more wonderful tendons of the
mind.</p>

<p>Often, to paraphrase Guts Muths, a girl
is weak because it does not occur to her that
she can be strong. She fails to lay the
foundations of health and strength which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page158">[158]</a></span>
should be laid; she fails to make the most of
the energy that she has; she fails to think
of the future and how important in every
way it is that she should be robust and full
of an abounding vitality. It is a matter of
the greatest importance to the world spiritually,
morally, physically, that its girls
should be strong. To be out of doors insures
abundant well-being as nothing else
can. The wilderness instinct, the instinct
for camping and all its out-of-door life and
sports, is the healthiest, sanest, and most
compound-interest-paying investment a girl
can make.</p>

<p>But by an intelligent approach to this life,
more can be put into it and therefore more
can be taken out, than by some blindfolded
dive into its mysteries. To know how to
do a thing worth doing and to do it well, is
both wise and economical. Some of the
physical aspects of our life will give all the
more value because of the payment of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page159">[159]</a></span>
added attention. A few simple rules for
the physical side of camp life will do quite
as much for the body as an orderly routine
can do for the camp housekeeping.</p>

<p>Simply because you are in camp, never do
anything by eating or drinking or over-strain
or folly of any sort, that is against the law
of health. To break the laws of health is
as much a sin in camp as out of it.</p>

<p>Eat an abundance of simple, wholesome
foods, using as much cereals, fruits, and
vegetables as you can get. Don&#8217;t neglect
the care of your teeth merely because you
are in camp.</p>

<p>Do not drink tea or coffee. Stimulants
are unnatural and unwholesome; no girl and
no woman should ever touch them. If you
have begun to drink tea and coffee, camp is
the place to give them up once and for all
time. The sooner the better.</p>

<p>If you can get a cool bath in stream or
pond and a rub down with a rough towel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page160">[160]</a></span>
so much the better. Exercise both before
and after the bath, and be sure, by rub down
and exercise, to get into a good glow. The
rub down is of especial importance, for it
stimulates all the tiny surface veins, is gymnastics
to the skin, and frees the pores of any
poisonous accumulations which they may be
holding. Drink a glass or two of pure
water when you get up and the same between
meals.</p>

<p>Never wear anything tight in camp or
elsewhere. Within the circle of the waist
line are vital organs which need every deep
breath you can take, every ounce of freely
flowing blood you can bring to them, every
particle of room to grow you can give them.
The Chinese woman who cramps her feet
sins less than we who cramp our waists.</p>

<p>Sleep ten or eleven hours every night.</p>

<p>Study to make your body well, strong,
and useful.</p>

<p>If you do all these things, you need not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page161">[161]</a></span>
worry about beauty; you will possess what
is of infinitely more value than a pretty face
and abundant hair, in having a sound, wholesome
body, self-controlled, instinct with joy,
with clean, glowing skin, a pleasure to yourself
and to everybody else. Clear vital
thoughts and a keener spiritual life will both
be yours. Because of the days in the woods
it will be easier to be good, easier to be
happy, easier to do the brain work of school
and college.</p>

<p>Part of the title of this chapter is Wood
Culture. I have something in mind that is
more than physical culture: The wilderness
cure, the lesson of the woods, a high spiritual
as well as physical truth. For the girl
who keeps her eyes open, here are forces at
work, mysterious, inspiring, wonderful, that
awake in her all the dormant worship and
vision of her nature. Yet of physical culture
in these weeks and days in the woods
too much cannot be said, for, as the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page162">[162]</a></span>
is beginning to realize, on one&#8217;s physical
health, cleanness, sanity, rests much of that
close-builded wonderful palace of mind and
soul. Every squad of girl campers should
have its physical culture drill, its definite exercises,
taken at a definite time, for ten or
fifteen minutes. Ten or fifteen minutes are
probably all that are necessary when practically
the remainder of the day is spent in
camp sports, canoeing, fishing, climbing,
hunting and so on. The object of these
physical exercises should be all-around development;
the drill should be sharp and
light with especial attention paid to breathing
and to the standing position. A steady
unflagging effort should be made to correct
round shoulders, flat chests, drooping necks,
and bad positions generally. Many and
varied are the exercises taught in school and
college,&mdash;exercises to which all girls have access.
I make no apologies for suggesting
a few of the simplest by means of which any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page163">[163]</a></span>
squad of girl campers can make a beginning
in physical culture.</p>

<p>(1) From attention (hands on hips),
place the palms of the hands flat on the
ground, keeping knees straight. Then
bring arms up above head. Do this eight
times.</p>

<p>(2) With hands on the hips and the
hips as a socket, rotate the whole trunk first
five times in one direction, then five times
in the opposite, being sure that the head follows
the line of the rotating trunk. The
difficulty of this exercise can be increased by
placing hands clasped behind the head, and
then later over the head. But the exercise
should be undertaken first with the hands on
the hips.</p>

<p>(3) In between each exercise take deep
breathing for a few seconds, rising on the
toes as you inhale and lowering as you exhale.</p>

<p>(4) Stand with the feet apart and arms
horizontal. Without bending the knee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page164">[164]</a></span>
place the right fist on the ground next to
the instep of your left foot. Then raise
the body and reverse, placing the left fist
on the ground next to the right instep.</p>

<p>(5) After this some free exercises with
the arms, taken with the head well up, chest
out, and shoulders back, make a good, sharp
light finale.</p>

<p>These exercises repeated several times
make an excellent beginning for any day,
either in or out of camp. You may unfortunately
be going through a state of mind,
when clean skin, good lungs and digestion,
seem to you negligible factors in life. How
tragically important these factors are, be
sure you do not realize <i>too</i> late, when both
body and soul, health and morals, have
been undermined.</p>

<p>Most girls need to look upon camp life
as an incomparably rich opportunity to gain
in an all-round physical development. The
life itself, aside from its possible physical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page165">[165]</a></span>
culture exercises and its sports of rowing,
paddling, swimming, climbing and walking,
is the big architect of a splendid substructure
for health. By taking thought, refusing
to eat greasy, unwholesome food, getting
plenty of sleep, avoiding over-strain,
taking corrective exercises, cool baths and
rub downs, there is no better health builder
than the wilderness life. A wise Danish
man said that &#8220;He who does not take care
of his body, neglects it, and thereby sins
against nature; she knows no forgiveness of
sin, but revenges herself with mathematical
certainty.&#8221; In the woods nature keeps reminding
you of this fact, and you are never
allowed to forget it for any length of time.</p>

<p>It is only sensible to care for one&#8217;s health.
It is not necessarily old maidish or silly to
take precautions that the camp health
should be at its zenith all the time. No
one would think of criticising a man for being
particularly careful of his horses under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page166">[166]</a></span>
new conditions. This is precisely what we
should be for ourselves. Your thorough-paced
sportsman is always regardful of his
physical condition. I have spoken about the
drinking of pure water, the care of food,
the folly of taking great risks, and of other
details. There are more factors, as well,
which will be at work in obtaining and maintaining
good health conditions.</p>

<p>The right sort of underclothing&mdash;and
women seldom wear suitable underwear&mdash;should
be worn. It should be high necked,
with shoulder caps and knee caps, and should
be of linen mesh. Every girl who is in fit
condition should see that each day has a
brief period at least of hard, warm, strenuous
work in it. A sweat once a day, with
a proper rub down afterwards, is one of the
best health makers on record. In &#8220;By the
sweat of thy brow shalt thou labor&#8221; was
enunciated one of the greatest of natural
laws. If it were possible for each one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page167">[167]</a></span>
us to sweat once a day, we should scarcely
ever know what sickness is. But our over-refined
civilization makes even the use of the
word an offence to certain middle class
people who care more for the so-called propriety
(they are the folk who say &#8220;soiled&#8221;
handkerchief instead of dirty, and &#8220;stomach&#8221;
when they mean belly, and yet are
ready to use such a detestably vulgar word,
straight out of the mouths of the lowest
classes of immigrants, as &#8220;spiel&#8221;) of what
is said than for its truth and strength. Lay
it down, then, that one of the first of the
camp health rules is a sweating every day.
Third among the camp rules is to keep the
bowels open. Do you know what one of
Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s mottoes for life was?
&#8220;Fear God and keep your bowels open,&#8221;
and in this saying there is no irreverence
whatsoever, nor any sacrilege, but only a
profound common sense that is a credit both
to the Maker and the great man who spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page168">[168]</a></span>
the words. Cascara is the best and safest
laxative for a girl to use in camp. It
should be bought in the purest tablets or
liquid form on the market, and all patent
cascara nostrums should be avoided.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> If there is a privy in the camp great care should be
taken that, for every reason, it is placed at a sufficient
distance from cabins and tents. It should <i>not</i> be placed
on a slope that could possibly drain off into any water
supply. An abundance of ashes should always be kept
within the privy and no water of any kind be poured
into the box. A few cans of chloride of lime should, if
possible, be kept on hand; and one can opened and in
use in the closet. Chambers and slop pails should not
be emptied in the immediate vicinity of the cabins but
at some distance and in different localities. There is
no greater abomination on the face of the earth than a
dirty camp, and no place which so thoroughly tests
one&#8217;s love of order, decency and cleanliness. If you
are following the trail and go into &#8220;stocked&#8221; camps for
the night, shake and air the blankets thoroughly, and,
out of courtesy to those who will follow you in their
use, shake and air the blankets when you get out of
them in the morning.</p></div>

<p>If a girl is delicate or under the weather
in any way, she must take more than the
ordinary care of herself or she may have a
head-on collision with out-and-out illness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page169">[169]</a></span>
The new mode of living, the various kinds of
exposure&mdash;especially to wet weather&mdash;, the
larger quantities of food eaten because of an
appetite stimulated by the vigorous outdoor
life, the temptation to overdoing&mdash;all these
possibilities should be kept in mind and
avoided as dangers. Don&#8217;t be silly about
overdoing. Harden yourself slowly for
the life; avoid competition. It is far better
to have lived your camp life successfully
and to have come out of it fresh and vigorous,
than it is to have done a few &#8220;stunts&#8221;
and have come out of it fagged, overstrained
and ill. It is well the first days of camp
life to try to eat less than you want; by this
act of self-control you will avoid the plague
of constipation which follows so many campers.
Moderate eating will mean more
sleep, too. Abundant water drinking and
a few grains of cascara should be able to
remedy all the ills to which camp flesh is
heir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>As a girl takes thought about this care
and culture of the body, making herself
clean within and without, higher lessons and
perfections, both of the mind and of the soul
will come to her as inevitably as the earth
answers to the touch of rain and sun. Do
you want to be happy? Very well then,
learn in the woods to be well, consider the
laws of health, and remember first, last,
and always that good health, not money or
position or fame or any shallow beauty of
feature, is the greatest and soundest security
for happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="fsize80">WILDERNESS SILENCE</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">M</span><span class="startword0">ost</span> friendships among girls,
and older people, too, suggest
that if there is one thing which is
hated, it is silence. If silence does happen
to get in among us in camp, how uneasy we
are! After an awkward pause we all begin
to talk at once,&mdash;any, every topic will serve
to break the hush which has fallen upon us.
And if we don&#8217;t succeed in getting rid of this
silence&mdash;something apparently to be regarded
as unfriendly and ominous&mdash;we make
excuse to do something and do it.</p>

<p>But of silence Maurice Maeterlinck, the
great Belgian author of &#8220;The Bluebird&#8221; and
of many other plays, too, says that we talk
only in the hours in which we do not live or
do not wish to know our friends or feel ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page172">[172]</a></span>
at a great distance from reality.
But where do we live more truly than in our
camp life? Then he goes on to say what I
think is equally true: That we are very jealous
of silence, for even the most imprudent
among us will not be silent with the first
comer, some instinct telling us that it is dangerous
to be silent with one whom we do not
wish to know or for whom we do not care
or do not trust.</p>

<p>Let us admit at the very beginning that
one does well to be on one&#8217;s guard with the
people with whom one does not care to be
silent,&mdash;but one does not go camping with
those people,&mdash;or, as the case may be, if
we, ourselves, have a guilty conscience or an
empty head much talking serves its ends.
And there is another situation in which it
seems almost impossible to be silent. There
is someone for whom we have cared very
much. Things have changed, there has
been a misunderstanding, we have altered or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page173">[173]</a></span>
someone else has made trouble between us.
And the first thing we notice is that we no
longer dare to be silent together. Speech
must be made to cover up our common lack
of sympathy. We talk, how we talk,&mdash;anything,
everything! Even when we are
happy we run to places where there is no
silence, but now, if only we can be as noisy
as children and avoid the truth of the sad
thing which has happened to us!</p>

<p>Again, let us admit at once that there are
different kinds of silence: There is a bitter
silence which is the silence of hate, and another
which is that of evil thoughts, and a
hostile silence, and a silence which may
mean the beginning of a storm or a fierce
warfare. But the only silence worth having
is friendly and it is of that we need to
think, and it is that we can have by the
camp fire in our wilderness life.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it true after all that the question
which most of us ought to ask ourselves seriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page174">[174]</a></span>
is not how many times we have talked
but how many times we have been silent.
Sometimes one wonders whether we are ever
still and whether if we are to be silent, it is
not a lesson which must be learned all over
again. How many times have we talked
in a single day? We can&#8217;t tell, for the number
of times is so great that we can&#8217;t count
them. And the times we have been silent?
And I don&#8217;t mean how many times we have
said nothing. To say nothing is not necessarily
to be silent. Well, we can&#8217;t count
the times we have been silent either, but
that is because we haven&#8217;t been still at all.
Yet there is a big life in which there is no
speech and no need of it. Are we never to
give ourselves a chance to live that?</p>

<p>Do you remember your first great silence?
Was it going away from someone you
loved? Perhaps it was a joyous visit to
your grandmother or to an aunt or to see a
friend, but it meant leaving your mother and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page175">[175]</a></span>
you had never left her before. Or maybe
it was your first year at boarding school or
your freshman year at college. Do you remember
the silence that came over you then
and all that filled it? And do you remember
how it wore away but gradually&mdash;that
grip the stillness had within you and
upon you? You know now that that first
silence will never be forgotten. Or was it
a return to those you loved and you realized
as never before how incomparably dear
these people were to you and that only silence
could express that dearness? Or was
it the silence of a crowd&mdash;awe inspiring silence
which foretells the acclaim of some
great event of happiness or a cry of woe?
Or the silence of the wilderness as you
looked down from a mountain side into
some great valley of lakes? Or was it the
death of someone you loved, and the silence
that overcame you forced you not only to
suffer as never before but also to think as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page176">[176]</a></span>
you have never done about the meaning of
life?</p>

<p>In that first great silence how many things
that are precious revealed themselves to us.
There was love; we did not realize how it
was woven into every fibre of our lives;
there was companionship; we did not realize
how bitterly hard it would be to forego it;
there was new experience; till it came we
could not have known how much a part of
our lives the old experience was. How
many things in us that had been asleep were
suddenly awakened! How much was that
great silence worth to us then and now?
Perhaps an unhappy or stricken silence we
called it then; but even if it meant death or
separation was it after all completely unhappy?
Have we taken into account the
wealth of conviction, of deepened experience,
of increased love it brought us? Could
anything so rich be in any true sense unhappy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, the Great Empire of Silence,&#8221;
cried Carlyle, &#8220;higher than the stars, deeper
than the Kingdom of Death.&#8221; The world
needs silent men but even more, I think, does
it need silent women. Carlyle&mdash;and you
should get what you can of his books and
read them&mdash;calls silent men the salt of the
earth. Might not silent women or silent
girls be called double salt? He says
that the world without such men is like a
tree without roots. To such a tree there
will be no leaves and no shade; to such a
tree there will be no growth; a tree without
roots cannot hold the moisture that is in
the earth and it will soon fade, soon dry up
and let everything else around it dry up,
too.</p>

<p>Have you not heard women and girls
with an incessant silly giggle or a titter or
a laugh that meant just nothing at all and
yet which was heard, like the dry rattle of
the locust, morning, noon and night? Nervousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page178">[178]</a></span>
partially; empty-headedness maybe,
or a mistaken idea of what is attractive.
Silliness of that kind has no place in camp.
Nothing is more wearying, more lacking in
self-control than such a manner, nothing so
exhausts other people. Such giggling or
laughing or silly talking is to the mind what
St. Vitus&#8217;s dance is to the body&mdash;an affliction
to be endured perhaps but certainly not
an attraction and not to be cultivated.</p>

<p>Is it not silence that opens the door to our
best work? How about that work you enjoyed
so much and did so well? How did
you prepare for that? Yes, I know all
about the work you bluffed through and even
managed to get a high record in, but that
work you really enjoyed, how was that
done? Is it not silence, too, that opens the
door to our dearest and deepest companionships,
our profoundest sorrows, our greatest
joys? Anyway this wilderness silence is all
worth while thinking about, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Why should this great silence, this friendly
wilderness power be considered anti-social?
Really, is it not most social? Does
it not bring us all nearer together, sometimes
even when we are afraid to be nearer to one
another? Does it not make us all equal,
making us aware of those profound things
in life which we all have in common? Silence
can say, can teach, what speech can
never, to the end of the world, learn to express.
It is safe to say that as soon as most
lips are silent, then and then only do the
thoughts and the soul begin to live, to grow,
to become something of what they are destined
to be, for as Maeterlinck says, silence
ripens the fruits of the soul. Never think
that it is unsociable people or people who
don&#8217;t know how to talk who set such a value
on silence. No, it is those who are able to
talk best and most deeply, think best and
most deeply, who, following the long trail,
recognize the fact that words can never after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page180">[180]</a></span>
all express those truths which are among
us&mdash;no, neither love, nor death, nor any
great joy, nor destiny can ever be expressed
by word of mouth, by speech.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="fsize80">HOMEMADE CAMPING</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">I</span><span class="startword0">t</span> was our second day in camp,&mdash;a
camp on the edge of the Maine wilderness.
Around us were many
lakes&mdash;ponds as the natives call them&mdash;Moosehead,
Upper Wilson, Lower Wilson,
Little Wilson, Trout Pond, Horse-shoe
Pond, and a dozen others. About us on
all sides were the forest-covered mountains,
and burning fiercely, twenty miles distant, a
large forest fire which filled the horizon
with dense, yellow smoke.</p>

<p>From our camp, consisting of a red
shanty, a log cabin in which I am now sitting,
my dog beside me, thinking what I shall
say to you about a remarkable family I saw,
and, looking up at the cabin ceiling, its log
ridge-pole and supports between which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page182">[182]</a></span>
birch bark cuts of trout and salmon caught
in the lakes, of which I have spoken&mdash;from
our camp we look out and down on a wonderful
view. Immediately in front of the
log cabin is a meadow, the last on the edge
of this wilderness, then the serrated line of
pointed firs, which marks the edge of the
woods at the foot of the meadow. Beyond
this line miles of tree-tops, pines, birches,
maples, beeches, after that the shining lakes,
and beyond them the mountains. There is
not a house in sight. For that matter there
<i>is</i> no house to be seen, not even a log cabin.</p>

<p>As was said, there is a meadow in front
of the cabin, and over to the right beyond
our view are two other meadows. In Maine&mdash;as
far north as this, anyway&mdash;the farmers
have only one crop of hay, and, when there
is so much forest, and the winter is long, and
cattle are to be fed, every meadow has to
be counted upon for all it will bear of hay.
It was a foregone conclusion that somebody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page183">[183]</a></span>
would need and use the crop from the meadow
down upon which my cabin looked.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, the second day we were
in camp, along the road bumping and thumping
over the big stones came a large hay
wagon: behind it, rattling and jarring, a
mowing machine and hay rake. But that
hay wagon, what didn&#8217;t it hold? In the first
place, there was the driver, then a big packing
box, a tent rolled up, sacks of feed for
the horses, a baby&#8217;s perambulator, three children,
a woman, a hammock, a long bench,
some chairs, including a rocking chair, and
several small boxes, packed to overflowing
with articles of various kinds. For an instant
it looked as if they were house-moving,
and then, recollecting that there was no
house to which to move, I came to the conclusion
that they were merely haying.</p>

<p>I watched them spread the big tent-fly and
make it fast. I saw them take out the large
packing box, converting that into a table, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page184">[184]</a></span>
which some of the children put flowers in an
old bottle; I watched them set out the bench
and chairs, swing the hammock, lay the improvised
table with the enamel dishes which
they took from the little boxes, and, in general,
make themselves comfortable.</p>

<p>The children had pails for berries, and
they began to pick berries in a business-like
fashion. The woman sat in the hammock
and took care of the baby&mdash;oh, I forgot to
mention the baby. The farmer and his lad
hitched and unhitched the horses, starting
within a few minutes to work with the mowing
machine, and leaving two of the horses
tethered to a tree. Evidently this was work
and a picnic combined&mdash;to me a new way of
getting in your hay crop. But the more I
watched it and thought about it the more I
liked it. And their dinner with the berries
as dessert&mdash;well, I knew just how good,
there in the sunshine, with appetites sharpened
by work, it must taste to them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside the cottage shanty of our camp, one
member of the household, at least, had been
doing her work in quite a different spirit. It
seemed to me that there was nothing which
this cook, a large, robust woman, with an
arm with the strength of five, had not found
fault with and made the worst of. Her
first groan was heard in the morning at six
o&#8217;clock&mdash;in getting up myself to go to my
writing table I had cruelly awakened her&mdash;and,
of course, as she went to bed only half
after seven the night before, she had been
robbed of her necessary sleep. As I say, I
heard her first groan&mdash;the sun was shining
gloriously, and I had already had a sun bath
and a cold sponge and my morning exercises&mdash;while
she continued to lie in bed and to
make every subsequent groan until after
seven o&#8217;clock fully audible.</p>

<p>She began that beautiful day and its work
in resisting everything. She had never been
in such a place before, and a very nice convenient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page186">[186]</a></span>
camp we, ourselves, thought it. She
groaned while she pumped water&mdash;I do not
know whether she or the pump made the
more noise. She complained loudly because
of the mice. Oh, no, she could not set a
mouse trap: she had never done such a thing
before! And then, when we got a cat, she
complained because of the noise the cat made
in catching the mice. I do not know precisely
what kind of a cat she expected, possibly
a noiseless, rubber-tired cat, that would
catch noiseless, rubber-tired mice. She would
not carry water&mdash;even a two-quart pail full&mdash;her
back was not strong enough. She had
never seen such dishes as these we were
using, nice, clean enamel ware dishes, with
blue borders. She had never heard of such
a thing as hanging milk and butter in a well
to keep them cool. Dear me, she never even
thought of going to such a place where they
did not have ice that would automatically
cool everything, and which the ice-man kindly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page187">[187]</a></span>
handed to her in pieces just the size
which she preferred. She said the spring&mdash;a
beautiful spring whose waters are renowned
for their purity and healthfulness
much as the waters of Poland Spring are&mdash;she
said that the spring had pollywogs in it
and frogs. She could not string a clothes-line,
but stood in tears near the big trunk of
a balsam fir, holding the line helplessly in
her hands and looking up to the branch not
more than two inches above her head.
While one of us flung the end of the clothes-line
over the branch and made it fast to another
she remarked with contempt, sniffing
up her tears, that it was not a clothes-line,
anyway, which was perfectly true, for it was
only a boat cord, but it did quite as well.
When she walked down from the meadow,
that glorious golden meadow, where the happy
family was picnicking and hay-making at
the same time, and through which wound a
little path down to the spring&#8217;s edge, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page188">[188]</a></span>
lifted her skirts as if she were afraid they
might be contaminated by the touch of that
clean, sweet-smelling, long grass. Still
groaning she would fetch about a quart of
water. And groaning, still groaning, she
went to bed at night &#8220;half-dead,&#8221; as she expressed
it, as the result of about five hours
of work, in which she was all the time helped
by somebody else.</p>

<p>Of course she was &#8220;half-dead.&#8221; It is a
wonder to me now, as I think of it, that she
did not die altogether. Instead of taking
things as they were in the sun-filled day, with
its keen, crisp air, its wonderful view, instead
of feeling something of the beauty and
health and sun and wind-swept cleanness of
it all, she had resisted every detail of the
day, every part of her work, she had, in
short, found fault with everything. This
day, that would have seemed so joyous to
some people, had not meant to her an opportunity
to make the best of things and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page189">[189]</a></span>
be grateful for the long sleep, the sunshine,
the invigorating air, the beauty, the light
work, but merely a chance to make the worst
of things, to throw herself against every
demand made upon her.</p>

<p>Out in front of the cabin the farmer swept
round and round with his mowing machine,
his big, glossy horses glistening in the sunshine,
the sharp teeth of the machine laying
the grass in a wide swath behind him. He
seemed peaceful and contented, although it
was warm out in the direct sunlight, and the
brakes were heavy and the horses needed
constant guiding. Down below, nearer the
spring, his wife swung in the hammock, and
the children picked berries, fetched water,
and were gleefully busy. It was a scene of
simple contentment with life.</p>

<p>When the father came back for his dinner,
which was eaten under the spread of a
tent-fly and from the top of a packing box,
decorated in the center with flowers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page190">[190]</a></span>
around the edges by contented faces, I said
to him: &#8220;You seem to be having a jolly
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, so we are,&#8221; was his reply. &#8220;I
offered the folks who own this meadow such
a small sum of money for the hay crop
I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get it. I thought some
one else was sure to offer them more, but I
guess they didn&#8217;t, for I got it. You see, it&#8217;s
pretty far away from my farm to come out
here haying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you make a picnic of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we are making a picnic of it. The
children like it. It&#8217;s great fun for them, and
it gives my wife, who isn&#8217;t very strong, a
chance to rest and be out of doors. I enjoy
it, too. I like to see them have a good
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, before I realized I was
taking him into my confidence, &#8220;I wish you
could make our camp cook see your point of
view.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t she like it?&#8221; he asked innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it? I am afraid she doesn&#8217;t. The
other day it rained and leaked in through
the kitchen roof onto her ironing board, and
when we found her she had her head on the
board and was crying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t she take that board out of the way of
the leak? We don&#8217;t mind a little thing like
a leak around here, especially when folks are
camping. Having her feel that way must
make a difference in your pleasure. Well,
there is ways of taking work. Now, probably,
she&#8217;s throwing herself against her
work, and making it harder all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what she is doing,&#8221; I commented
dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity.&#8221; There was sympathy in his
voice. &#8220;For it&#8217;s such a lot easier to make a
picnic out of what you are doing&mdash;homemade
camping, we call this. My folks always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page192">[192]</a></span>
feel that way about it. Even the hardest
work is easier for taking it the right end
to. My children are growing up to think,
what it doesn&#8217;t hurt any man to think, that
work is the best fun, after all. It&#8217;s the only
thing you never get tired of, for there is always
something more to do.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE CANOE AND FISHING</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">I</span><span class="startword0">t</span> was my somewhat tempered good
fortune, several years ago, to spend
two or three weeks in an exceedingly
bleak place on a far northern coast. The
only genial element about this barren spot
was its sea captains, and whence they drew
their geniality heaven only knows. They
made me think of nothing so much as of the
warm lichen which sometimes flourishes upon
cold rocks. There strayed into this neighborhood
a couple of canoes. &#8220;Waal,&#8221; exclaimed
one of the old salts, viewing this
water craft skeptically, &#8220;it&#8217;s the nearest next
to nothing of anything I have ever heard
tell on.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that is precisely what the canoe is:
the nearest next to nothing in water craft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page194">[194]</a></span>
which you can imagine. It is in precisely
this nothingness that its charm lies, its lightness,
its grace, its friskiness, its strength, its
motion, its adaptability to circumstances.
There are times when it acts like a demon,
and there are other times when its intelligence
is almost uncanny. The canoe is always
high spirited, and, with high-spirited
things, whether they be horseflesh or canoe,
it does not do to trifle. The girl who expects
to take liberties with the canoe has some
dreadful, if not fatal, experiences ahead of
her. Several years ago I was out in a motor
boat with some friends. Two of them had
been, or were, connected with the United
States Navy; another was my sister, and a
fourth was a college friend. My friend
happened to see a pistol lying on a seat
near her. She had never had anything
to do with pistols, and, on some insane
impulse of the moment, she picked it up and
leveled it at me. I was stunned, but not so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page195">[195]</a></span>
the men on the boat. Such a shout of rage
and indignation, such a leap to seize the pistol,
and such a rebuke, I have never been
witness to before. These men were navy
men, and they knew how criminally foolish
it is to fool with what may bring disaster.
It is those who know the canoe best and are
best able to handle it, who are most cautious
in its use. Those of you who expect to treat
it as you might the family horse would do
well to look out.</p>

<p>The canvas-covered cedar canoe is the
best. If you are going to take a lot of duffle
with you, the canoes will have to be longer
than you need otherwise have them: about
eighteen feet, and only two people to a
canoe. The canoe will cost you from twenty-five
dollars up, and this item does not include
the paddle. The paddle should be
bought exactly your own height; it will
then be an ideal length for paddling. Its
cost will be a little more or a little less than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page196">[196]</a></span>
a dollar and a half. You should have a
large sponge, tied to a string, on one of the
thwarts. This you will use for bailing when
necessary.</p>

<p>If you have had any experience with a
canoe, you will not abuse it, and will not
need to be told not to abuse it. If it is a
light one, and you are a strong girl, you
should learn to carry it Micmac fashion on
the paddle blades, a sweater over your shoulders
to serve as cushion. Watch a woodsman
and see the way he handles a canoe.
One of the very first things you will observe
is that he never drags it about, but lifts it
clean off the ground by the thwarts, holding
the concave side toward him. Also, you
should observe his soft-footed movements
when he is stepping into a canoe. If a canoe
is not in use it should be turned upside down.
Never neglect your canoe, for a small puncture
in it is like the proverbial small hole in
a dike. If you let it go, you will have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page197">[197]</a></span>
heavy, water-soaked craft or a swamped one.
Water soaking turns a seemingly intelligent,
high-spirited canoe, capable of answering to
your least wish or touch, into the most lunk-headed
thing imaginable, a thing so stupid
and so dead and so obstinate, that life with
it becomes a burden. Remember that the
wounds in your canoe need quite as much
attention as your own would.</p>

<p>The balance of a canoe is a ticklish thing.
To the novice, the day when she can paddle
through stiff water while she trolls with a
rod under her knee and lands a two- or
three-pound salmon unaided, seems far off.
I am by no means a past-master in the art of
canoeing, yet I have often done this, and am
no longer troubled by the question of balance
in a canoe. So much for encouragement!
Most of an art lies, granting the
initial gift for it, in custom or habit. Make
yourself familiar with the traits of your
canoe, work hard to learn everything you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page198">[198]</a></span>
should know about it, and your lesson will
soon be learned.</p>

<p>When you are going to get into it, have
your canoe securely beside a landing, and
then step carefully into the center and middle.
Bring the second foot after the first
only when you are sure that you have your
balance. The next thing is to sit down. Be
certain that it is not in the water. The
only satisfactory recipe for this delicate act
is to do it. No girl should step into a canoe
for the first time without some one at the
bow to steady it. Very quickly you will
learn clever ways of using your paddle to
help in keeping the balance. Until you do,
you can&#8217;t be too careful, or too careful that
others should be careful. Take no chances
in a canoe. If any are taken for you, hang
on to your paddle. It is well to have an inflatable
life-preserver, but, best of all, is it
to know how to swim. Never move around
in a canoe, or turn quickly to look over your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page199">[199]</a><br /><a id="Page200">[200]</a></span>
shoulder. A canoe is a long-suffering thing,
but once &#8220;riled&#8221; and its mind made up to
capsize, heaven and earth cannot prevent
that consummation and your ducking or even
drowning.</p>

<p>Become skillful in the use of the paddle,
and the best way to learn is through some
one who knows how. Paddling is an art
and a very delightful one, requiring much
skill of touch and strength. Although as a
girl I cared most for rowing, I have in the
last ten years become so devoted to the paddle
stroke, to its motion and touch and efficiency,
that rowing only bores me. Get
some one, a brother, a father, a friend, a
guide, to teach you the rudiments of paddling.
These once learned, canoeing is as
safe as bicycling and not more difficult. It is
all in learning how.</p>

<p class="allclear">The writer is an old-fashioned fisherwoman
and goes light with tackle. However,
I have noticed that the simplicity of fishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page201">[201]</a><br /><a id="Page202">[202]</a></span>
tackle does not in the least interfere with
luck. If you are going to fish with worm,
hook, and sinker, you will need no advice.
Perch, pickerel, black bass, cat-fish, and
others to be caught in still fishing, will be
your quarry. As a rule you will troll for
pickerel and pike, and there is no sport more
pleasant in the world than that which is to
be had at the end of a trolling spoon: the
motion of the boat, the vibration of the line,
the spinning of the spoon, and then the sudden
strike, with all its possibilities for taking
in big fish. I defy anyone to have a
more exciting time than netting a salmon
from a trolling line and landing it successfully
in a canoe. But this is not a thing to
be attempted by the novice. Much better let
the salmon go and save yourself a ducking.</p>

<p>The finest art of all fishing is fly-fishing.
One either does or does not take to it naturally,
after one has been taught something of
the art by brother, father, or guide. Alas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page203">[203]</a></span>
that the fish greediness of campers is making
good fly-fishing, even in the wilderness,
more and more difficult to get! Personally,
if I am after trout or salmon, &#8220;plugging&#8221; or
&#8220;bating,&#8221; as it is called, seems to me an unpardonably
coarse and stupid sport. Yet our
lakes have been so abused by this process
that fly-fishing is frequently impossible. To
sit or stand in a canoe, casting your line, the
canoe taking every flex of your wrist; to see
the bright flies, Parmachenee Belle or Silver
Doctor&mdash;or whatever fly suits that part of
the country in which you are camping&mdash;alight
on the surface as if gifted with veritable life,
and then to be conscious of the rush, the
strike, and to see a rainbow trout whirling
off with your silken line, is to experience an
incomparable pleasure. To have a strike
while the twilight is coming on, a big fellow,
with the line spinning off your reel as if
it would never stop, to see your salmon leap
into the air and strike the water, to reel him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page204">[204]</a></span>
in, then plunge! and down, down he goes;
to feel the twilight deepening as you try
to get him in closer to the canoe again; to
know suddenly that it is dark and that the
hours are going by; to feel your wrist aching,
your body tense with excitement; to
think that you are just tiring him out, that
you have almost got him&mdash;almost, then a
rush, a plunge, the line slackens in your hand,
and he is gone. That is fisherman&#8217;s luck,
and great luck it is, even when the fish is
lost.</p>

<p>Only a few words about fishing tackle.
Have a good rod or two, but don&#8217;t begin
your experience at fishing with expensive
tackle. The cheaper rod will do quite as
well until you learn what you want. For
trolling the best rod is a short steel one.
For fly-fishing you will always use split bamboo
or some similar wood. You will have
accidents, so have reserve tackle to fall back
upon. In any event do not buy a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page205">[205]</a><br /><a id="Page206">[206]</a></span>
rod, and never buy anything with a steel
core in it. If you can afford it, get a first-class
reel, one that works easily and is of
simple mechanism. A simple winch reel is
the best. Avoid patented contraptions.
While you are using them hang your rods up
by the tips. In any event keep them dry and
in as good condition as possible. Enameled
silk line you must have for all trout fishing.
For other kinds of fishing it does not so
much matter what you do use, provided the
line is strong and durable. Be sure to have
extra lines to fall back on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="fsize80">THE TRAIL</span></h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="firstletter">A</span> <span class="startword1">girl</span> who has learned to camp
will not only have her own pleasures
greatly increased, but she will
also add to those of her friends, becoming a
better companion for her chums, her father,
her brother; for camping, if it is anything,
is a social art. It is far better for a girl
to be out in the world which demands all of
one&#8217;s attention, one&#8217;s eyes and ears and nose
and feet and hands and every muscle of the
entire body, than to be leading a sedentary
life at home, or analyzing emotions or sentimentalizing
about things not worth while.
The big moose which unexpectedly plunges
by provides enough emotions to last a long
time; the land-locked salmon that threatens
to snap the silken line, enough excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>You can&#8217;t learn all that there is to be
learned in the school of the woods through
one camping expedition. It would be rather
poor sport if you could. Don&#8217;t be afraid to
ask questions about what you don&#8217;t know.
Keep on asking them until you are wood-cultivated.
The wilderness is your opportunity
to make up for those vitally interesting facts
about life which are not taught in schools.
Above all, have a map of the country in
which you are, and study it. Keep that map
by you as if it were Fidus Achates himself,
and refer to it whenever there is need. The
girl or woman in camp who never knows
where she is is a bore, sponging upon the
good-nature and intelligence of others who
have taken the trouble to familiarize themselves
with the lie of the land. Such a
girl never makes any plans, never takes the
initiative, never gives anyone a sense of rest
from responsibility. There are girls and
older women who think it rather clever to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page211">[211]</a></span>
be unable to tell east from west, north from
south. I may say here that in camp they
belong to the same class of foolish incompetents
who in college boast that they cannot
spell&mdash;presumably because they are devoting
themselves to a much higher call upon their
intelligence than anything so superficial as
spelling! If camping means anything in the
world, it means co&ouml;peration, and this co&ouml;peration
should be all along the line.</p>

</div><!--plate-->

<p>If you have an innate sense of direction,
train it. If you have none, do not venture
out into the wilderness except with someone
who has. Always tell people where you are
going. If you are not familiar with the use
of a rifle you would better have a shrill whistle
or a tin horn to use in case you want to
summon anyone. Sun and wind should be
part of your compass; the trees, too. You
will, of course, learn how to blaze a trail,
and the sooner you do this the better, for it
is good training in following out a point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page212">[212]</a></span>
the compass. The wilderness is full of signs
of direction for your use, some of which are
certain to be serviceable at different times,
and some of which will not prove dependable.
The sun rises in the east and sets in
the west. At high noon of a September day,
if you turn your back squarely to the sun,
you will be looking directly north. The
wind is a helper, too. When the sun rises,
notice the direction of the wind, and, while
it does not shift, it will prove a good compass
or guide. If it is very light, wet the
finger and hold it up. By doing this the wind
will serve you as a compass. Remember,
also, that the two lowest stars of the Big
Dipper point toward the North Star, which
is always a guide to be used in charting a
wilderness way. Also on the north sides of
trees there is greater thickness to the bark
and more moss. This is, I suppose, because
the trees, being unexposed to the sunlight on
the north side, retain the moisture longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page213">[213]</a><br /><a id="Page214">[214]</a></span>
there. Some say, too, that the very topmost
finger of an evergreen points toward the
north. Even in civilization they usually do.
To become familiar with a compass is a very
simple matter. Every boy learns this lesson,
and there is no reason why girls should not
do the same. Never buy a cheap compass;
it is not to be relied upon. To the amateur
in the woods a good one is not a friend at
which to scoff. A few expeditions out behind
the cabin will teach you all you need
to know about its use. If by some miscalculation
a girl should get lost, let her realize
then that the great demand is that she shall
keep her head on her shoulders, where it has
been placed, and where she will need to make
use of it. Let her sit down and think, reviewing
all that has happened, and trying to
solve the problem of what she is to do. A
panic is the last and worst thing in which
she can afford to indulge. To most people
at some time or other comes the conviction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page215">[215]</a><br /><a id="Page216">[216]</a></span>
that they are lost&mdash;a conviction happily dispelled
in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases
out of a thousand. In this, as in everything,
a miss is as good as a mile, and one does
well to make light of unavoidable mistakes.</p>

<p>As you go through the woods, cross the
ponds and lakes, climb mountains, your
luncheon in your pocket, compass and knife
and cup and match-box all ready and friendly
to your hand; as you feel the wilderness becoming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page217">[217]</a><br /><a id="Page218">[218]</a></span>
more and more your empire, be sure
that you do not abuse the privileges which
are revealed to you. The more gentle and
considerate you are in this life which has
opened itself up to you, the more it will tell
you its secrets. That you should leave disfiguration
and destruction and bloodshed behind
you does not prove that you are in any
sense a true sport. The camera is one
of the best guns for the wilderness. It is
better to be film-thirsty than bloodthirsty. A
girl who is in earnest about camera shooting
can test her &#8220;nerves&#8221; quite sufficiently for all
practical purposes. How about facing, or
chasing, a six- or seven-hundred-pound
moose, plunging down through a cut or a
trail, and having the nerve to press the bulb
at just the right moment? Or a big buck?
Or a little bear? Or a porcupine? A good
kodak and some rolls of film are all that is
needed to begin the work of photography.
A fine way to do, if you intend to go into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page219">[219]</a></span>
the matter seriously, is to get some book on
nature photography and make a thorough
study of it. Other books, too, there are,
which will be full of profit for you as you
come to know the wilderness life. Begin
with Thoreau, John Burroughs, John Muir,
Stewart White, Ernest Seton Thompson, and
these will lead you on and out through a
host of nature books and finally into a more
technical literature on hunting, camping, and
the wilderness life in general.</p>

<p>I believe that in the end an intelligent
study of the woods made with eyes and ears,
heart and mind, notebook and book, will
bring down more game than any shotgun or
rifle ever manufactured. I have seen guide-books
of northern wildernesses whose collective
illustration suggested only the interior
of some local slaughter house. No tenderfoot
myself, for, when the first shotgun was
placed against my shoulder, I was so little
that its kick knocked me over, I do not write<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page220">[220]</a></span>
this way because I am unfamiliar with the
pleasures of well-earned or necessary game,
but because I have tried both ways and I prefer
a friendly life in the wilderness. To kill
what you see, just because you do see it, to
set big fires, to be wasteful, to take risks in
your adventures, are no signs that you know
the woods&mdash;and they are most certainly no
guarantee of your love.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
